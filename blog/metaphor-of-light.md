**[Zig](#1754 "2018-08-23 02:51:18"):** Really good essay! Well done. In response, I'd just say that I agree with Derrida, Levinas and the likes, but I don't think that the metaphor of light should be abandoned entirely as such. A hybrid thought should be sought: scrutinising what is in the light (because truth resides there, too) while at the same time keeping the dark in mind as well (so as to avoid the grasping of objects). My thoughts, anyway.
