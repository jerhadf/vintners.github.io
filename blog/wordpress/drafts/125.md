# It

Recently, I have thought intensely and genuinely about what could motivate a person to support Donald Trump. When I say that I find it nearly impossible to conceive of supporting Trump, I mean it. This is not primarily because I disagree with him politically. Rather, it's because there is nothing to disagree with. Trump does not have policies. More than any previous politician, his campaign consists of images, buzzwords, nicknames, and provocative hooks. Watching Trump in the media is like reading the first sentence of a novel again and again, watching the first episode of a series on seemingly infinite repeat.
