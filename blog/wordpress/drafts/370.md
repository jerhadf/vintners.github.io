# Defending Utilitarianism in the Ruins of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

This title is as bad as it sounds. Yes, I am going to defend utilitarianism. Yes, in the context of the nuclear bomb strikes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the Second World War. The bombings were unequivocal atrocities. In a better world, the conditions that precipitated them would never exist. But the historical evidence and the ethical arguments leads me to think that the bombings were necessary to avoid even more heinous suffering.
