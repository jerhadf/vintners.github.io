# On Mocking Religion

I have found myself guilty of something quite unpleasant: the mocking and disregard of beliefs that others hold dear. Over time, as I have developed a more intimate understanding, I have increasingly begun to vandalize and deride the religion-based understandings of others, I have, as Bacon worded it, inclined to "profane scoffing in holy matters, which doth little by little deface the reverence of religion."
