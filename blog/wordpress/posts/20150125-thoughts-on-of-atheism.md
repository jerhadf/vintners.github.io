# Thoughts on 

["Of atheism"](http://essays.quotidiana.org/bacon/atheism/) is an exceptionally elegant essay, written by one of the most renowned developers of the modern scientific method, Francis Bacon. I really enjoy it, mostly because the concepts are so fluently presented, though I rarely agree with their content. I'll discuss some of the more interesting precepts of the essay here.
