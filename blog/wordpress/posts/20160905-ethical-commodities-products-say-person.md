# Ethical Commodities: What Our Products Say About Our Person

Today, [Colin Kaepernick's jersey is the fifth-most bought jersey in NFL history](http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kaepernick-jersey-sales-soar-amid-controversy/story?id=41861482). Until the events of the last few weeks, the phrase "I bought a Kaepernick jersey" would be meaningless except to a select group of football fans. Now, to wear a Kaepernick jersey is to carry an immense weight, one almost as heavy as a Black Lives Matter t-shirt. Our commodities say as much or more than our speech.

**[Frank Kelland](#844 "2016-09-05 12:05:25"):** Bene scripta! I am glad to see a Maeser student investigating contemporary ethos. Maeser stripped itself of liberal thinkers early in its history.
