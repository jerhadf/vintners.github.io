# What Matters in a President, and Why Electability Doesn

I'm not going to argue for any of the candidates in this post. That'll come later. For now, I think there are three main factors that should be considered in a president. They are all interrelated, and in order of importance. However, if a candidate doesn't meet any one of these criteria, it is practically impossible to meet any of the other criteria.
