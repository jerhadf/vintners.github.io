# Why I Love the Office

I love it because it juxtaposes absurd, delusional people against unabashed authenticity. This comparison isn't exactly subtle, but it is never explicitly said. Jim and Pam become protagonists not because they receive the most screen time, or the story is told from their perspective, or they overcome all their challenges and become exceptional - rather, it's precisely the opposite. They aren't heroes. They are merely authentic, and we can only relate to them because they are the only real people within this office landscape of hollow appearances.
