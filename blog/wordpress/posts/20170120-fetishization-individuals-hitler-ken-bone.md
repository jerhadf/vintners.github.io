# The Fetishization of Individuals: From Hitler to Ken Bone

Humans have a relentless tendency to treat individuals as microcosms for the world. If we can identify a certain individual who fits into a group, we generalize this individual and make him/her representative of the group or concept as a whole. When we speak about these concepts or groups, we are implicitly thinking of these fetishized individuals. Thus, the 'philosopher' becomes Plato; the 'drug lord' becomes Pablo Escobar; the 'autocrat' becomes Hitler. These people that stand as concrete symbols for entire ideas are what I call 'fetishized individuals.'
