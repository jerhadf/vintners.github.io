		<title>The Incompatibility of Kantianism and Christianity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.
<p style="text-align: left;">-- Matthew 5:48</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm about to argue that one cannot be a Christian and a Kantian at the same time. Before I do that, we'll need some definitions: First, as deontology, or duty-based ethics, is a broad field, I'll limit it to Kantian deontology, as set forth in the <em>Metaphysics of Morals. </em>Second, Christianity will be defined as belief in Yawheh; the deific nature, atonement, and resurrection of Jesus; and a general belief in the truth of the Old and New Testaments. Now on to the argument.</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Summary </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. The Christian God does not act immorally; he is morally perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2. The morally perfect Christian God performed the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">3. The Atonement of Jesus Christ is immoral under a Kantian framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">4. Thus, Christians may not be Kantians and maintain rational consistency.</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Premise one: The Christian God does not act immorally.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As shown in the opening quote, the Bible frequently repeats that God is perfect, and it supplicates God's followers to strive to be perfect like him (Deuteronomy 18:13 is another good example, though it is ironic, considering the atrocities committed by God in that same book). Furthermore, moral perfection is one of the defining aspects of the concept of God; if God is not morally perfect, then why call him God? Why not just an advanced human? An omniscient being would necessarily know all things, including the nature of morality, and an omnibenevolent being would necessarily follow the nature of morality.</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Premise two: The morally perfect Christian God performed the Atonement of Jesus Christ. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is not very controversial, though it gets slightly strange if you are trinitarian, considering the whole 'God sacrificing himself and then praying to himself on the cross' deal. The only controversy may arise around how exactly God went around performing it; was it God who did it, or was it Jesus for the sake of God, or was it Jesus' singular choice? And how much choice, exactly, did Jesus have? He was most certainly <img class="alignleft wp-image-36 size-medium" src="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/christ-on-the-cross-205x300.jpg" alt="Christ's atonement" width="205" height="300" />coerced, after all, by the fact that everyone's souls would be set on fire if he didn't atone for them. Like the coward that I am, I'll avoid these questions by simply saying that God caused the Atonement to happen by integrating it into his plan. Again, there is the question of how much choice God had in creating the plan, but regardless, he created the plan, and that inevitably led to the Atonement.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Premise three: The Atonement of Jesus Christ is deontologically immoral. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is quite clear that Kantian deontology would rule the Atonement immoral. The Atonement distinctly violates the primary principle of Kantianism: we should never act in such a way that we treat others as a mere means to an end. It is using Christ as a mere means to an end, primarily as an instrument for the benefit of the vast majority. I do not mean 'mere' as a derogatory term, but rather as a philosophical condition: mere as in 'little more than as specified.' The Atonement, after all, was not a mere act, but a pivotal point in Christian theology.  However, it is almost universally recognized that Christ was never an end, but that he was always a means. After all, he was called the Lamb for a reason: he was a sacrifice for the sake of others. He offered all of his glory unto his father. This is the type of 'sacrifice of the minority for the majority' situation that Kantians condemn. Christ went through horrific tortures, suffering  the pain of literally everyone, so that the sins of humanity could be erased. This is permissible under a teleological moral framework, where the means can be justified by its ends, but abhorrent under a deontological, and especially Kantian, moral framework.</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Conclusion: Christians may not be Kantians and maintain rational consistency. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One who believes in a morally perfect God must also model his/her morality around this God. Any action that this God performs is necessarily good, and so mortals cannot deny the morality of the action and must, instead, agree with it. It would be irrational and contradictory to say that a morally perfect God did something immoral. If the Atonement is immoral under a Kantian framework, then either God is morally imperfect, the Kantian framework is false, or God does not exist. Only one of these options allows one to retain their status as a Christian, which I defined as one who believes in a morally perfect God, among other things. The other option is to believe that Kantianism is false.</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Possible criticisms </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. God and humans have different moral standards. It is justified for God to kill, but it is not justified for humans to do so. It is justified for God to bystand in the face of suffering, but it is not justified for humans to do so. Thus, we do not have to base our morality on God's.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2. Kant's morality is only for autonomous wills (Stanford), and God did not have any choice in the Atonement. It was a necessary aspect of the universe. Thus, he was not an autonomous will, and he was not making the sort of act that Kantianism applies to.</p>

I will use my website and my other methods of making content go viral online for the purpose of promoting the Jew's agenda of multiculturalism, destruction of the white race, pro-transexualism, socialism, etc. I am ready to work for the Zionists and stop all propaganda efforts to expose the Jew's agenda. All you have to do is email me and offer me a job. I can be either your greatest ally or your greatest enemy, so choose wisely, Zionists and Jews. If you do not accept me into your ranks, I will spend the rest of my life exposing the entire Jewish conspiracy and making it go viral in front of millions of people. You have 48 hours to contact me.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Political compass: January 24, 2015: </strong>

<a href="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-23-at-5.36.39-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14" src="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-23-at-5.36.39-PM-300x291.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-01-23 at 5.36.39 PM" width="300" height="291" /></a>

&nbsp;

This is where I land on the political map, according to the politicalcompass.com's test. It seems pretty accurate. I guess I'll be chillin' with Ghandi, then.

<strong>Political compass: January 19, 2016</strong>

<a href="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2016-01-19-21.54.14.png" rel="attachment wp-att-75"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-75" src="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2016-01-19-21.54.14-300x273.png" alt="Screenshot 2016-01-19 21.54.14" width="309" height="281" /></a>

Remarkably, I have not moved at all on the economic level - I'm still significantly left-leaning. Also surprisingly, I moved right on social issues, not left. The largest change, I think, is that I have become much more politically engaged. When I first took this test, I had basically just discovered politics. I remember asking Mr. Dowdle what side he thought I was on because I did not know myself. Since then, I've thought about and developed a position on almost every political issue.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[And she stood, pushing her trembling body out of the mire of manure and moss that covered the floor of the cavern. Above her was the Red-Fanged Beast, towering, smoke and poisonous gases leaking out of the corner of his half-open mouth that could not contain his immense teeth, even when they were broken and half-gone. It stared through its black pits down at the half-child human girl, and she stared back up at it, defiant but with a hint of pleading in her eyes. Long ago, its sight had been taken from it by the cold steel arrows of men, but it could see her there, a living tithe offered to a Beast that wanted nothing but to end it.

The Beast shifted forward, and the girl flinched imperceptibly. An uncontrollable wave of primal fear rushed through her. She stifled it. Her father had said to die like a man, die like her mother had, without fear. But the Beast did not crush her with its huge, coarse hands just yet. it walked slowly  past her, and she was transfixed by its movement. The Beast reached the opening of the cave. it was touched by the warm sunlight, and a low rumble of pain emanated from it. it reached upward and dug its hands into the rocky ceiling, then pulled downward. The girl watched, and then realised what it was doing. She ran toward the Beast and threw her fists at its feet wildly.

“Stop! We are both going to die in here!” She screamed. it took no notice. She dug her fingernails into its thick, black-grey skin. She bit it. The cave shook and dust fell from the ceiling. A boulder fell outside the cave and blocked the light. The dark red veins of the Beast throbbed from the exertion. At last she stopped her vicious assault and collapsed. A tear slipped from her white-clouded eye and she immediately, instinctively,  wiped it away, hoping that no one had seen. The mountain was groaning and parts of the cave had already fallen. She looked upward and it was already looking down, at her. it had heard the sound of the tear. it was a sweet, delicate sound, but shockingly loud. it pulled its hands from the ceiling, reached down toward the girl’s face and touched it, lightly. She pulled away, punching the hand. But it was too late.

It had felt the wetness of her cheek. It had not been lying to itself. She had cried. And as the mountain collapsed around them both, the Beast cried also. Crimson blood seeped from its skin, dripping and falling to the shaking floor. The girl watched in horror. it’s sightless craters, now filled with blood, stared at her in desperation that she could not understand, hoping beyond hope that she would someday know truth. Then its blood became a river, pouring from gaping wounds that had opened themselves. And the floor of the cavern was covered with its sticky, foul-smelling blood. And then the Beast fell, almost crushing the girl but stopping itself, rooting its hands into the ground, locking its arms in place. Then its head drooped as the last of its lifeblood seeped out of it.

There was near silence, for a brief moment, as the eye of the storm passed. And then the mountain fell, and boulder after boulder pounded the huge, broad, rough back of the Beast, as the porcelain girl hid beneath it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A cool mist rose from the slow-moving waters of the Rubicon. On the north bank of the river was Gaul and the legion of Gaius Julius Ceasar. To the south was Italy Proper and the seat of Roman power. The river was a dividing line: one that was forbidden to be crossed by any general leading forces. To cross would mean civil war.

The faces of the legion were stoic, unchanging; they stared blankly across the water and towards Rome, but their minds were all focused on the same thing. Would their general lead them across, would he order them to attack their homeland and wage war on their brethren? Or would their march end here?

Ceasar was more than aware of the misgivings of his soldiers. But he was also confident in their loyalty. He had depended on them to follow him as much as they had depended on him to lead them. Thus was the bond and the way of Legio XII Gemina and its leader. Ceasar knew, if he crossed, the world of Rome would collapse as he knew it and a war like none ever seen before would follow. The support he had was sufficient, and he was almost certain that, at the end of the bloodshed, he would emerge victor. This is what he deserved, and he expected no less.

A ray of sunlight broke through the cold mist, and when Caesar looked up toward the skies, an eagle eclipsed the sun, casting its shadow upon the river. The legion needed no more sign, and their doubts were almost instantly dispersed.

Julius Caesar took the first step into the river, breaking the mirrored surface.

<strong>"Alea iacta est." He said. <i>The die is cast. </i>His eyes focused on the capital of the greatest empire that ever stood, less than six days march away. He would hobble the very empire he was born to serve and lived to protect; and this step would become the fall of the Republic of Rome and the rise of the Roman Empire. As he continued to wade forward, and the water churned as the legion followed, Caesar's gaze never broke from Rome. </strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Warm rain thrashed the filthy streets, scarring the bent, twisted and frail city that was Jodhpur. A boy wandered the alleyways, his feet wrapped in rags, clutching a tiny piece of bread. A small calf - Raksåka - followed him, nudging the boy with her warm, wet muzzle every time she caught up. The two knew each other well. Both were young, raised without a taste of their mother's milk, starving orphans in a desecrated paradise.

They trudged through the city, avoiding contact with the other urchins that filled these streets. Suddenly the boy turned, standing in front of the holy animal with the confidence of desperation and fatigue. The calf continued to walk forward, aimlessly bumping into the boy. The boy, insulted, grabbed Raksåka by the head and wrestled her to the ground. Squealing, but unable to move, the calf kicked desperately until she was too tired to struggle. Then the boy released her. She scrambled to her feet. The boy tackled her again.

Malnourished as they were, this happened only three times before they collapsed. But the boy rose quickly from his exhaustion. He held the calf on the cobbled streets for the greater part of the hour. Then both of them rose, and the calf began to wander once again. But the boy would not be walking any farther. He leaped on the calf's knobbled back, holding on desperately to her slippery skin. Raksåka did nothing, continuing her pointless roamings with the tiny weight of the boy on her back.

The rain continued, but seeing it was useless to try and avoid soaking their rags and saris and expensive Western clothing, the people left their houses and returned to their work. They watched with amazement as the boy, who had tamed the beast of the streets, rode past them. They named him Gaysavār, rider of the cow, king of starving orphans.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Voices clamored for attention, pushing the small, dark boy toward the makeshift trampoline. Estev had contrived his brainchild from a collection of rubber from spare tires, young wood, and some metal springs he had saved up for, then, after a month's worth of work, bought from the ancient church-man from down the road.

The children screamed excitedly, grabbing almost desperately at his feet.

Estev's emotions were quiet, as always. Cold, empty thoughts raced through his mind, hindered only by the occasional sharp pain in his right leg. It was better than it had ever been, and the wheelchair Estev had built for the twisted, broken leg had been taken apart and used for other creations. Almost a year had passed since he had built the trampoline, yet it still hadn't been christened by it's creator's tattered shoes.

The voices grew louder and the words came more frequently, rising steadily and quickly. But it would never reach its crescendo of sound.

"I'll do it," he said, and the group went quiet. He had always been the one left out, the one who spent days building and earning and saving and working and inventing and dreaming, then watched his friends enjoy the fruits of his labor. It was a shocked silence. Then one of them cheered, and the group erupted into laughter and cries of triumph. He felt a host of cold hands push him forward.

Without second thought, Estev leaped. His legs slammed into the rubber, and the trampoline thrusted him into the cold winter air. A heavy, inescapable weightlessness enveloped him. He turned, his legs moved impossibly slowly, and the excited screams of the boys around him slowly faded into silence, replaced by the whispers of the air.

Thoughts sped through his mind, so much to think, so little time before he returned to the hard earth, to the world that had never accepted him. He no longer knew which way was forward, and he couldn't know where he would land. It was thrilling, terrifying. Did he truly want to leave this life? This life of restrictions and oppression, and yet of the purest freedom. Did he want to know where he would land?

<strong>The boy's feet slammed into the ground, and he forgot it all. The whispers of the air faded, and the wild screams returned as the boys leaped on their older friend. They pulled him to the ground. They were laughing, he was laughing, and he had lost the thoughts of the cold winter air. </strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[No more, no less, than fifty years had passed since they all had disappeared and he had been left.

Vilero, as they called him, was staring toward the distant coast of America: a dark line that fringed the distant horizon, barely visible in the mist of the Carribean. The scarlet rays of the setting sun could not penetrate this mist. It was gray or white or a pale blue, and heavy as a blanket of lead.

Sitting on the seawell stretched across the island’s coast, like he had every night since they’d left. The Malecón held back the waves unceasingly, but what was it guarding; what was it protecting from the tide? There was nothing left here. The pale glow of the streetlights reflected off the water and fell upon the cold cement of the Malecón. Its illumination did not reveal anything, and the whispers of the streets were silent. He remembered this same night.

An hour passed. The rain had begun to fall, and Vilero remained. A collection of boys crowded into an empty doorway to hide from the torrent of water from above. Their breath was warm, their hands shaking with energy and just beginning to feel the cold. It hadn’t rained like this in a very, very long time. Vilero was waiting for snow in Havana, but perhaps this freezing rain was the closest he would ever come.

He didn’t know exactly how long it had been, for whenever he tried to remember his mind was clouded with memories of those he had lost. The streets had raised him, and they had raised him well, but a son always takes the spirit of his father. Vilero was the son of these muttering streets.

He slipped off the Malecón, plunging into the waters of the Carribean. They were not as warm as they had been years ago, and while they weren’t cold, a strange chill shivered up Vilero’s old body as he sank. He did not even struggle as he died, and it was not a death of fear or sadness. This was the end he had been waiting for. This is the happy ending.

<strong>A corpse floated to the surface, exposing itself to the night air. A young couple were sitting by the Malecón, and they saw the body. They stared at it, but did not move.</strong>

		<title>Synaptic Pruning</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This is a short informative essay I  wrote for the final project of the Neurobiology course from the University of Michigan. </em>

Synaptic pruning, or synaptic elimination, is an essential aspect of the development of the brain. It is when the brain destroys itself, removing unwanted synapses, neurons or neuronal configurations to increase efficiency of connections. The process and timing of  pruning is thought to be significantly changed by the experiences, genes, and even the thoughts of the developing mind.

During early childhood, there is a huge proliferation of connections between neurons, usually peaking around the age of two. The adolescent brain then cuts down the amount of connections, deciding which ones should be kept and which can be let go. While there are various theories as to the molecular mechanisms by which pruning actually occurs, most agree that pruning is primarily carried out by a very motile form of glial cell, called microglia [1], which is the first part of the nervous system that is active during synaptic pruning. These microglia are thought to remove cellular debris during the healing process of an injured brain, but in the healthy, developing brain they have a possibly more important function. If a synapse receives little activity, it is weakened and eventually deleted by microglia and other glial cells. After the synapse has been removed, the space and resources that it once used are taken by other synapses, which are then<img class="  wp-image-31 alignleft" src="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/synapsesgraph.jpg" alt="synapsesgraph" width="245" height="165" /> strengthened.These processes [2] and various others take place throughout development, peaking at adolescence and ending around the age of 21, and transform the brain to create more complex and efficient neuronal configurations.

Various factors can affect the methods, timing, and results of synaptic pruning. Comprehensive research [3] has shown that mutations in genes lead to abnormalities in the pruning process that lead to unwanted connections remaining active or important connections being pruned out, impairing the brain permanently.  Some neuroscientists have made educated guesses as to the nature of these mutations, and there has been relative consensus that microglia, being part of the immune system, remove the synapses because they appear to be either unnecessary, damaged, or a foreign object. This abnormal synaptic pruning could be a significant source of the symptoms of schizophrenia [3]. Pruning is also highly dependent on experience. Neural plasticity reaches its peak during childhood and before synaptic pruning begins. Thus, if a child begins to learn a language or any other complex function before synaptic pruning, that function will be deemed important and the neural connections pertaining to it will be kept and strengthened [4]. This gives new meaning to the saying “use it or lose it.” Experiences during and before synaptic pruning are perhaps some of the most important in development, because they directly affect brain function for the rest of the subject’s life. It is thought that connections deleted during pruning cannot be regained. "The fact that there are more connections [in a child's brain] allows things to be moved around," said physiologist Ian Campbell from the University of California, Davis. "After adolescence, that alternate route is no longer available. You lose the ability to recover from a brain injury, or the ability to learn a language without an accent. But you gain adult cognitive powers.” [5]. Your actions during pruning affect which circuits remain in existence and which do not.

It is not fully known what the function of synaptic pruning is, while the general explanation of “pruning removes unnecessary connections” is the most widely accepted and well-researched. It remains unknown whether connections removed during pruning can ever be regained. Pruning is often thought to represent learning, but this is almost certainly an oversimplified explanation for a very complex cluster of processes. Synaptic elimination may also be a method utilized by the brain to adapt to the most efficient form of thinking in its specific environment [6].

There are a wide variety of very interesting questions that deal with synaptic pruning. One that has intrigued me specifically is whether children and adolescents who have not fully undergone synaptic pruning are more creative than adults. It seems that large amount of synapses leads to more overall thought, and thus we can infer that before pruning, the brain is more sidetracked and inefficient. If distraction aids creativity, as a considerable amount of research shows, then that would mean that the more distracted, pre-pruning mind is more creative than the post-pruning mind. Some researchers believe that synaptic pruning is determined somewhat by the culture and society in which the child is raised. This would mean that after pruning, an adult in one society no longer has the same neuronal connections as an adult in a different society - those connections have been trimmed out. Is this an underlying cause of culture shock and/or genocide? Is the developing mind more open to change and new connections then the “narrow,” developed mind? Until the scientific community has a greater understanding of synaptic pruning, these questions will remain unanswered.

Synaptic pruning remains only barely understood by scientists, and the research already conducted has shown that it is far more complicated than previously thought. It is a critical part of neurobiological development that has tremendous consequences on the fully developed adult.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://essays.quotidiana.org/bacon/atheism/">"Of atheism"</a> is an exceptionally elegant essay, written by one of the most renowned developers of the modern scientific method, Francis Bacon. I really enjoy it, mostly because the concepts are so fluently presented, though I rarely agree with their content. I'll discuss some of the more interesting precepts of the essay here.

&nbsp;

<strong>A little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism; the contemplative atheist is rare </strong>
<blockquote>
<pre>"A little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion for while the mind of man looketh upon second causes scattered, it may sometimes rest in them, and go no further; but when it beholdeth the chain of them confederate, and linked together, it must needs fly to Providence and Deity."</pre>
</blockquote>
This is an intriguing claim, and prompted me to question my own atheism...which, I realize while I write this, is ironic, as Bacon said that "the contemplative atheist is rare." I am deeply contemplating my own position, even reconsidering it, as a result of his words; meanwhile, I would be hard-pressed to find a religious person who could so easily be prompted to seriously contemplate his beliefs, much less bring them into a suspecting light.

I have never met a true atheist who does not frequently, deeply contemplate his beliefs, though perhaps the 'true' modifier creates a selection bias. When I say "true atheist," I mean someone who has genuinely reached atheism as a result of learning and intellectual progress, rather than one who has defaulted to atheism, implicitly accepted it, or merely asserted it via dogma instead of through a search for knowledge. Thus, almost all true atheists will also be contemplative. However, to do justice to religion and its fervent adherents, I will accept that there is also such thing as a "true theist," who has reached theism through a genuine search for truth.

Perhaps Bacon is suggesting that most atheists are not true atheists, but rather dogmatists and negligently-intellectual, shallow thinkers. This, I would argue, is false, and largely for the reason that most atheists are not raised to be atheist, but rather become atheist as a result of questioning, critical thought, and analysis of the evidence. After all, more than 84% of the world is religious, according to a<a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/"> PEW study</a>, and thus the vast majority of people are raised to be religious; it requires one to break out of the mold to be an atheist, and breaking out requires more contemplation and depth than remaining in the status quo. Furthermore, there are significant consequences of atheism, as atheists are one of the most discriminated-against groups on the planet, especially in America (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/26/atheist-discrimination-humanist-association_n_5531296.html">Hafiz 2014</a>, <a href="http://freethoughtreport.com/">Freedom of Thought Report</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/16/atheists-discrimination_n_4413593.htmlhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/16/atheists-discrimination_n_4413593.html">Wing 2014</a>). Thus, it is extremely unlikely that an atheist would expose himself to this sort of detestation without serious contemplation. For these reasons, true atheists are more common than untrue atheists. Because most people are born into a religious household and there are huge pressures to remain religious, there are more untrue theists than true theists.

There are also philosophical arguments that show that more theists are untrue than atheists, the first of which being the obvious: theism is false, thus, theists are more likely to have epistemologically culpable beliefs than atheists.

Second, religious, supernatural explanations (which are not really explanations at all) require little or no understanding. If you do not understand a phenomenon, just claim that Thor, Baal, Zeus, ghosts, sky pixies, or God did it. This does not take any real understanding; you do not need to understand air currents, air pressure, electricity, or storms to explain that Thor creates the lightning. A religious "______ did it" is often the default when one is ignorant about something, while atheist explanations require much more contemplation and understanding; to explain a rainbow in an atheistic fashion, for instance, requires an understanding of the interactions between the light and water in the upper atmosphere, <img class=" wp-image-48 size-medium alignright" src="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/goddidit-300x300.png" alt="goddidit" width="300" height="300" />while religion would once again proclaim its time-tested motto: God did it. Thus, an atheist is more likely to be contemplative than a theist, and it requires a greater depth of understanding - or as Bacon put it "depth in philosophy" - to explain the world with an atheist paradigm.

&nbsp;

<b>The teleological argument </b>
<blockquote>
<pre>"...that an army of infinite small portions or seeds unplaced should have produced this order and beauty without a divine marshal."</pre>
</blockquote>
While I won't thoroughly refute this argument here, I would say that  a deeper examination of the evidence would yield an understanding of the unity, diversity, order, and beauty of life and the universe that does not require a divine creator. Using Bacon's scientific method, we have developed the explanation of descent with modification, found extensive support for the Big Bang theory, have discovered the fundamental particles and forces of physics, and are continually learning more about the world and explaining it increasingly accurately.  We have become almost fluent in the language of the universe. Bacon would be astounded at these new explanations, and I would like to think that a critical thinker like himself would reconsider his position if he lived in our epoch.

Furthermore, as discussed above, the dumbfounding beauty and complexity of the cosmic vista stands in stark contrast with the simplistic supernatural account of reality. That God, or the "divine marshal," made all the complexity is an intellectual excuse for a meager understanding of the universe. Supernaturalism is a superstitious pseudo-explanation; an evasion of true elucidation.

&nbsp;

<strong>Why should they trouble themselves? </strong>
<pre>"...if they did truly think that there were no such thing as God, why should they trouble themselves?"</pre>
Admittedly, <img class="alignleft wp-image-47 size-medium" src="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/satisfiedwithnotunderstanding-214x300.png" alt="satisfiedwithnotunderstanding" width="214" height="300" />this is a good question, though it does have a good answer. If there is no god, why do atheists concern themselves with him? The truth is, we don't want to trouble ourselves. Religion is so endemic, however, that it's difficult to avoid it. It is extremely abusive of the non-believing community; its oppression is inescapable. Personally, I try to talk about atheism and concern myself with the God hypothesis to help me to think, to prompt other people to think, and to show to people that atheists are not Satan-possessed fiends. Eventually, if enough atheists are out there, talking and showing themselves, we may become accepted; it will no longer be a filthy, sinful, hate-deserving thing to non-believe. I do not want others to have to go through the same grueling experience as I did when 'coming out' as atheist. I do not want them to be terrified to doubt the existence of the rhetoric-gilded sky pixie.

&nbsp;

<strong>Depriveth human nature of the means to exalt itself</strong>
<pre>...it depriveth human nature of the means to exalt itself above human frailty.</pre>
<div id="container">
<p class="reference">Oh, I wish that his eloquence was being applied to religion, because it, more than anything, deprives human nature of the means to exalt itself above human frailty. It offers remote Elysiums and unreachable heavens out of a fear that humans cannot be moral without an infinite bounty of celestial mansions. It tears down true efforts to transcend our natural infirmities and frailties. Religion subsidizes the efforts against stem cell research. It instructs its devotees and their drafted children that science is fraudulent, that evolution is false, that believing without justification is okay, and that education is dangerous.</p>
<p class="reference">And the "means to exalt itself above human frailty" are science, rational thought, and technology. Our population has risen from a mostly disease-tormented, scuffling, and starving three million to an advanced, literate, and less-suffering seven billion through these means. We eradicated smallpox through these means. Granted, there is still suffering, but do we truly expect religion to fix that? So far, it has mostly caused suffering, through supposed holy wars and radicalism and hatred of those that it labels as less, from women and blacks to nonbelievers and gays. Instead, we should find compassion for the suffering and the oppressed, and then fix their problems in means that yield true success. We should transcend human frailty using means that actually work.</p>

		<title>On Mocking Religion</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have found myself guilty of something quite unpleasant: the mocking and disregard of beliefs that others hold dear. Over time, as I have developed a more intimate understanding, I have increasingly begun to vandalize and deride the religion-based understandings of others, I have, as Bacon worded it, inclined to "profane scoffing in holy matters, which doth little by little deface the reverence of religion."

There are several justifications that other atheists offer for their jests at religion, the most prominent being that religion is not a holy thing, that it does not deserve respect, and that it is false. I agree, to some extent, with all of those things, but I do not find them reason to scorn religion and the religious.

[caption id="attachment_53" align="alignright" width="272"]<img class="wp-image-53 size-medium" src="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/criticizing-religion-272x300.jpg" alt="Oscar Wilde, 1882. LEHTIKUVA / EVERETT COLLECTION / Jerry Tavin" width="272" height="300" /> I most certainly agree that religion should be criticized, but I am less certain about whether or not I should not mock it.[/caption]

Even if religion is not a holy matter, its adherents believe it to be so, and mocking their beliefs will only turn them against atheism even farther. Too often, believers see atheists as enemies, largely due to our derision of what they hold sacred. A welcoming discussion of religion is far more productive than a mutually derisive one, and it will dispel the  prejudice against atheism far more.

Mocking religion, I have found, has made me more callous and unapproachable, and it consistently dispels joy and meaning within myself. Even if the scoff is based on veracity, it elicits emotions of loathing rather than of compassion and openness. These emotions have caused the sectarian hatred that has torn apart our world, and I try to avoid them whenever possible.

[caption id="attachment_54" align="alignleft" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-54 size-medium" src="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Whatwrongwithmilitantatheism-300x169.jpg" alt="Whatwrongwithmilitantatheism" width="300" height="169" /> An argument for mocking religion.[/caption]

Finally, a true application of the golden rule would dictate that we remain respectful of another's beliefs, as we would want them to be respectful of ours. The religious use the same justifications to dismiss and deride our evidence-based beliefs as we use to mock their faith-based beliefs. Regardless of the epistemics, this law of mutual kindness, I think, remains valid. We should not use the same strategies of hatred against religion that for so long religion has used to burn us at the stake and exclude us.

Still, while I, myself, have found that this scoffing has made me more callous and less happy, that it has made the subjects of the mockery turn against me, and that it is counterproductive to my esteemed values of truth and unity, I think that perhaps there are reasons that others should partake in it. One principal reason is that satire of religion will, indeed, "deface the reverence of religion." It is strange that the religious establishment is considered immune to criticism, and if one questions it, they are treated just as a child who has unfolded his arms or opened his eyes during a prayer, despite the well-supported argument that none of it is true. Well-aimed jests at religion may help to reduce the masses' perception of its inviolability, and assist in lifting the illusion of immunity. These will <img class=" size-medium wp-image-55 alignright" src="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-25-at-4.34.51-PM-300x300.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-01-25 at 4.34.51 PM" width="300" height="300" />have immense positive effects, not the least of which being that the religious may question the religion that they thought was unquestionable. Again, however, there are a variety of reasons against mocking religion, and it too often gets out of hand.

		<title>It&#039;s True if it Gets Enough Upvotes: An Essay on Baudrillard &amp; Trump</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, I have thought intensely and genuinely about what could motivate a person to support Donald Trump.  When I say that I find it nearly impossible to conceive of supporting Trump, I mean it. This is not primarily because I disagree with him politically. Rather, it's because there is nothing to disagree with. Trump does not have policies. More than any previous politician, his campaign consists of images, buzzwords, nicknames, and provocative hooks. Watching Trump in the media is like reading the first sentence of a novel again and again, watching the first episode of a series on seemingly infinite repeat. ]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Keating felt a warm pleasure; he had influenced the course of a human being"

Why had he always feared that mysterious entity of consciousness within others?

"You've made a mistake already. By asking me. By asking anyone. Never ask people. Not about your work. Don't you know what you want? How can you stand it, not to know?" - Howard Roark, pg 33

"I don't intend to build in order to have clients. I intend to have clients in order to build." - Howard Roark, pg 26

"The best is a matter of standards - and I set my own standards. I inherit nothing. I stand at the end of no tradition. I may, perhaps, stand at the beginning of one." - Howard Roark, page 25

"The proper creative process is a slow, gradual, anonymous, collective in which each one collaborates with all the others and subordinates himself to the standards of the majority." -- The Dean, page 25

{ "My dear fellow, who will let you?" - The Dean

"That's not the point. The point is, who will stop me?" - Howard Roark } - page 22

"People were his protection against people...Others gave Keating a feeling of his own value." - pg 73

Example of how Roark finds value in his work, not in his escape from work: He sees a car streaking by where people are rejoicing that work is over. "He thought that there was a difference, some important difference, between the consciousness of this day in him and in them." -- pg 135

Metaphor of a house's integrity for a human's integrity: "A house can have integrity, just like a person," said Roark. "And just as seldom." ... "Every piece is there because the house needs it, and for no other reason." -- page 136

Howard's definition of freedom, presented on page 144, is "To ask nothing. To expect nothing. To depend on nothing." This is a Buddhism of profound capitalism, in that it requires that the individual frees himself from all drive for acceptance in order to accept himself.

Peter gives a profound description of the way life slips through our fingers: "Just the feeling I was in mortal danger, that something was closing in on me, that I'd never escape it, because it wouldn't let me and it was too late." - Peter "That you'd never escape what?" - Katie "I don't know exactly. My whole life. You know, like quicksand. Smooth and natural. With not a thing you can notice about it or suspect. And you walk on it easily. When you've noticed, it's too late..." pg 151

Peter has no standards without others. On page 171, he hates his own work because he depends on others for its value. "...it might be good. He was not sure. He had no one to ask."

"He was great; great as the number of people who told him so. He was right, right; right as the number of people who believed it. He look at the faces, at the eyes; he saw himself born in them; he saw himself being granted the gift of life. That was Peter Keating, that, the reflection in the staring pupils, and his body was only its reflection." - Page 188

Sitting on the porch, Peter's lover Catherine talking about their future together, "...he did not hear her words; he was thinking of how it would look if they were photographed like this together and in how many papers it would be syndicated." -- page 188

The description of love in<em> the Fountainhead</em>, however, is despicable. As in the affair between Frank Underwood and Zoe Barnes in <em>House of Cards, </em>Ayn Rand describes love as essentially a power relation. Frank Underwood: "A great man once said, everything is about sex. Except sex. Sex is about power." Dominique falls in love with Roark primarily because, as she says, he was the "...abstraction of strength made visible." (page 205) She seeks to be dominated by him, but she also seeks to find some way in which she can own him - "She thought suddenly that the man below was only a common worker, owned by the owner of this place, and she was almost the owner of this place." (page 205) "She found a dark satisfaction in pain - because that pain came from him." (page 209). But on the other hand, she sometimes is insightful about love. This is the one area in which Roark is dependent: he remarks on page 218, "It was strange to be conscious of another person's existence, to feel it as a close, urgent necessity; a necessity without qualifications."

On peter keating: "He was a great man - by the grace of those who depended on him." pg 223

"...he was certain it was profound, because he didn't understand it." - Peter keating, page 233

"Listen, what's the most horrible experience you can imagine? To me—it's being left, unarmed, in a sealed cell with a drooling beast of prey or a maniac who's had some disease that's eaten his brain out. You'd have nothing then but your voice—your voice and your thought. You'd scream to that creature why it should not touch you, you'd have the most eloquent words, the unanswerable words, you'd become the vessel of the absolute truth. And you'd see living eyes watching you and you'd know that the thing can't hear you, that it can't be reached, not reached, not in any way, yet it's breathing and moving there before you with a purpose of its own. That's horror. Well, that's what's hanging over the world, prowling somewhere through mankind, that same thing, something closed, mindless, utterly wanton, but something with an aim and a cunning of its own." - Steven Mallory

Mallory on why he shot at Ellsworth Toohey: "Howard, I shot at him because I think he knows everything about that beast." - Steven Mallory

Ellsworth Toohey says that when we destroy the ego, and when we do, the gates of heaven will fall open. In one of his rare moments of lucidity, Peter says "But...when the gates fall open, who is it that's going to enter?" - page 365

"But I don't think of you." - Howard Roark, page 389

Steve Mallory on page 452 describes how Howard Roark seems immortal because his identity never changes. This misses the mark.

Dominique to Peter Keating: "But you have to flatter people whom you despise in order to impress other people who despise you." 424

"He wondered whether the particular solemnity of looking at the sky comes, not from what one contemplates, but from the uplift of one's head." Gail Wynand, page 553

Dante describes the worst wickedness as the betrayal of another person. For him, it is Judas Iscariot who double-crossed Christ, Cain who murdered his brother, and Brutus who killed Caesar who deserve the lowest circle of hell. But to Ayn Rand, the most horrific crime is to betray yourself. Gail Wynand declared on page 550 that he was "the man who had committed every crime except the foremost one: that of ascribing futility to the wonderful fact of existence and seeking justification beyond myself...<em>I </em>was the use and the meaning. I, Gail Wynand." (page 550)

This is love: needing another "in the total, undivided way...the kind of desire that becomes an ultimatum, 'yes' or 'no', and one can't accept the no without ceasing to exist." -- page 502

“I like to see a man standing at the foot of a skyscraper,” he said. “It makes him no bigger than an ant--isn't that the correct bromide for the occasion? The God-damn fools! It's man who made it--the whole incredible mass of stone and steel. It doesn't dwarf him, it makes him greater than the structure. It reveals his true dimensions to the world. What we love about these buildings, Dominique, is the creative faculty, the heroic in man.” - Gail Wynand

<strong>Page 539: </strong>

“But the ability to say 'Yes' or 'No' is the essence of all ownership. It's your ownership of your own ego. Your soul, if you wish. Your soul has a single basic function--the act of valuing. 'Yes' or 'No,' 'I wish' or 'I do not wish.' You can't say 'Yes' without saying 'I.' There's no affirmation without the one who affirms. In this sense, everything to which you grant your love is yours." (Roark)

“In this sense, you share things with others?" (Wynand)

“No. It's not sharing. When I listen to a symphony I love, I don't get from it what the composer got. His 'Yes' was different from mine...That answer is too personal to each man. But in giving himself what he wanted, he gave me a great experience. I'm alone when I design a house, Gail, and you can never know the way in which I own it. But if you said your own 'Amen' to it--it's also yours. And I'm glad it's yours.” (Roark)

"[Peter Keating is] paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling himself that he’s been too selfish. In what act or thought of his has there ever been a self? What was his aim in life? Greatness—in other people’s eyes. Fame, admiration, envy—all that which comes from others. Others dictated his convictions, which he did not hold, but he was satisfied that others believed he held them. Others were his motive power and his prime concern. He didn’t want to be great, but to be thought great. He didn’t want to build, but to be admired as a builder. He borrowed from others in order to make an impression on others. There’s your actual selflessness. It’s his ego that he’s betrayed and given up. But everybody calls him selfish." - Howard Roark, page 605

"Can you rule a thinking man? We don't want any thinking men." - Ellsworth Toohey, page 637

"The creation, not its users. The creation, not the benefits others derived from it. The creation which gave form to his truth. He held his truth above all things and against all men." - Howard Roark, page 678

"No man can use his brain to think for another. All the functions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be shared, or transferred." Howard Roark, page 679

"The creators concern is the conquest of nature. The parasite's concern is the conquest of men." Howard Roark, page 679

"To a creator, all relations with men are secondary." Howard Roark, page 680

"Men have been taught that the highest point is not to achieve, but to give. Yet one cannot give that which has not been created. Creation comes before distribution - or there will be nothing to distribute." Howard Roark, page 680 (this is the difference between Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. Tesla is a creator, Edison is a distributor. Likewise, Newton and Leibniz were consumed by their search to be recognized as the inventors of calculus.

"The choice is not self-sacrifice or domination. The choice is independence or dependence." Howard Roark, page 681

Misses the mark: "All that which proceeds from man's independent ego is good. All that which proceeds from man's dependence upon men is evil." Howard Roark, page 681

The beauty of capitalism: "Men exchange their work by free, mutual consent to mutual advantage when their personal interests agree and they both desire the exchange." Howard Roark, page 682

Misses the mark: "Every major horror of history was committed in the name of an altruistic motive. Has any act of selfishness ever equaled the carnage perpetrated by disciples of altruism?"

"Who permitted them to do it? No particular man among the dozens in authority. No one cared to permit it or to stop it. No one was responsible. No one can be held to account. Such is the nature of all collective action." Howard Roark, page 684. This describes well what I was trying to say one day in socratic, about why obedience without thought is a crime.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The poster of Che Guevara could be anything. I could place a capitalist quote, from Ayn Rand, and we would not notice much incongruity. He has become divorced from his Marxist origins and meaning.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Generally, I'm a very analytical person. In an election, and especially this one, I fear that if I do not force myself to justify my positions then my beliefs will become entirely arbitrary. For example, first impressions of a candidate's appearance is the third most accurate predictor of state election results, after only incumbency and campaign spending (<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/on-the-face-of-it-the-psychology-of-electability">source</a>). While I'll inevitably fall prey to some cognitive biases, I try to minimize these through in-depth analysis. With that, here's my review of this election.
<h3>The Criteria</h3>
I consider three primary factors in a president: character, competence, and policy. Generally, this is what each of those factors mean:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Character - </strong>This consists mostly of the the moral standards and honesty of the candidate. If I do not trust a candidate, their competence becomes irrelevant, as it will not be used ethically. Their positions become meaningless because they will abandon policy and ethical standards at will. Character also includes temperament and personality, as an angry, irrational, and unstable candidate is a danger to the world and ineffective in diplomacy.</li>
 	<li><strong>Competence </strong>- The proven experience of the candidate, their intelligence, and their ability to implement policies effectively. If a candidate isn't politically competent, their policies won't matter because they will never be implemented. Intelligence is not measured by IQ, but by the candidate's understanding of the world, their rationality, their education, and their working ability</li>
 	<li><strong>Policy </strong>- The stated positions of the candidate. If every candidate could be trusted to follow their policy statements exactly and implement them effectively, this would be the only issue. Despite its importance, policy is <em>by far</em> the least-discussed issue in this election.</li>
</ol>
<h3>On Electability</h3>
Electability, for me, is mostly a non-issue. Of course, a candidate must have some chance of becoming president, or we will be divided into minuscule factions and candidates will only have to win a small portion of the vote to take the election. However, "some chance" is a low margin. For example, Zoltan Istvan, the transhumanist candidate, is not on the ballot in any state and is not polling at more than 5% in any state (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/06/15/zoltan-istvan-2016-lets-make-americans-immortal/85929946/">source</a>). This is below the "some chance" margin, as 25 days from the election, he has no path to the presidency. However, Evan McMullin, an independent candidate, is on the ballot in 11 states (<a href="https://www.evanmcmullin.com/how_to_vote_for_evan">source</a>), has a significant chance of winning Utah (<a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865664606/Poll-Trump-falls-into-tie-with-Clinton-among-Utah-voters.html">source</a>), and has a growing campaign nationally. If a candidate passes this minimum threshold of electability, we should move on and consider the three most important factors.

Our democratic obligation is to vote for the candidate we support. Otherwise, our system degrades and no longer represents the population, as the contemporary philosopher Slavoj Zizek described:
<blockquote>We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligence to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be.</blockquote>
If we do not vote our conscience, we as a population fail to represent ourselves. We do not 'throw our vote away' when we vote for an unlikely candidate we genuinely support, rather, we throw our vote away when we do not vote what we believe. We are not voting for ourselves, but for someone else, for the polls, for the average. Popular opinion becomes the popular opinion of what the popular opinion is; democracy devolves into regressive guessing at the average. Furthermore, government is only legitimate when it represents the governed. When we do not represent ourselves, our government becomes illegitimate.

Finally, there are a ton of misconceptions about voting power in our democracy. First, <a href="https://fee.org/articles/how-not-to-waste-your-vote-a-mathematical-analysis/">statistical analysis</a> shows that, in general, your vote has the most power if you vote for a third-party candidate, not for a major party. Second, the power of a single vote is extremely close to zero, so the best reason to vote is not really to control the election, but to represent ourselves. Third, a lot of the time, your publicly expressed opinions matter more than your vote, because these opinions influence a significant amount of votes. Who you support actively matters more than who you vote for quietly. Fourth, whether or not your candidate is elected is not the only measure of voting power. You could say all the Bernie Sanders votes this year were wasted because he didn't win, but he still radically influenced the election and changed American politics permanently. Winning ≠ success.
<h2>Candidates</h2>
Alright, I'll do this in ascending order of how okay they are. In other words, I'll start with Donald Trump, who is most definently not okay.
<h3>Donald Trump</h3>
Trump is unquestionably out of the question. Our perception of his character infinitely approaches zero as we learn more about him. He changes his positions constantly (see this <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/full-list-donald-trump-s-rapidly-changing-policy-positions-n547801">full list</a>), lies constantly and has no regard for evidence or truth (see <a href="http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/">Politifact</a>), has a shockingly racist history (<a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12270880/donald-trump-racism-history">source</a>), grossly discriminatory rhetoric (he speaks for himself), and is irredeemably misogynistic. His policies, in a vast understatement, are incomprehensible and counterproductive. A small summary:
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>On economics:</strong> According to a comprehensive report by the <a href="http://www.crfb.org/papers/adding-donald-trumps-campaign-proposals-so-far/">Committee for A Responsible Federal Budget</a>, Trump's tax plan would increase our national debt by $12.1 trillion in the next decade. It would cut federal revenue immensely, and the only solutions would be to cut federal spending by up to 80% (impossible with Trump's defense spending increases) or increase economic growth to 10% annually (which is nearly literally impossible). He has had constant bankruptcies in his personal life, and he will morally and financially bankrupt our country.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>On global security: </strong>Trump's violent, nuke-promoting, alliance-destroying, and warmongering policies would demolish global and national safety. He has <a href="http://realnewsrightnow.com/2015/08/trump-i-will-absolutely-use-a-nuclear-weapon-against-isis/"><em>literally </em>said</a> he would strike ISIS with nuclear Trident missiles, which have seventy times the destructive power of the bombs dropped in Japan. The use of nukes would kill countless civilians, permanently eliminate diplomacy with most of the Middle East, and would likely start a global war. He has said he will walk away from the NATO alliances, which has been remarkably effective in deterring conflict and nuclear proliferation (<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/29/hillary-clinton-is-right-donald-trump-threatens-world-war-iii.html">source</a>). Not only was Trump undeniably for the Iraq War (<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2016/02/donald-trump-and-the-iraq-war/">source</a>), but he is currently promoting the same nationalist, violent, and irrational foreign policy that got us into this mess in the first place.</p>
I think that's enough. Honestly, I don't really want to discuss this one too much. Discussion can only happen when both parties share a roughly similar standard of rationality and morality. I have yet to see any justification for Trump that accepts a paradigm of valid rational analysis or rejects violations of basic human and civil rights.
<h3>Gary Johnson</h3>
&nbsp;
<h3>Jill Stein</h3>
<h3>Evan McMullin</h3>
Let's get this out of the way: <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-evan-mcmullin-could-win-utah-and-the-presidency/">McMullin could win. </a>

McMullin is clearly very sensible. I have <em>immense </em>respect for him as a person, and I've been impressed with his rationality, openness, resolute morality, and understanding. He has denounced the empty politics of this election and I agree with a lot of his ideas. If McMullin won Utah, I would not be salty at all.

His core seems to be defense of the Constitution. Return to federalism, stop centering power in Washington D.C. We are far more represented by state and local governments, so power should not be centered as much in Washington. States should be able to chart their own courses. Not necessarily united on every issue, but localized by states.

Secure border with Mexico practically. Path towards legal presence. Immigrants should be in line with everyone. Prioritize skilled workers imported into the country. Best ideas are from immigrants. Encourage immigration system.

LGBT rights - he's okay with it.

We need real reforms on federal lands. States should manage federal lands. "That's an issue that I'm passionate about"

However, it's difficult to make a decision, as he does not have well-defined set of polices, he has no political experience, and he hasn't had enough time in the election to flesh out his positions and defend himself. For example, I couldn't find what he thinks about the NSA, and he has not publicly discussed most of his policy platform outside of national security.

Lower corporate tax rate.

Regulation hurts small companies, helps bigger companies. Air on the side of competitiveness, not crony capitalism.

If you care about the value of your vote, vote for Evan McMullin.

As far as his current policy positions go, here are my most important problems:

<strong>National security: </strong>

<strong>Environment: </strong>Global warming is incredibly urgent and should be one of the most important issues this election.

Economy:

		<title>Absolute Truth and Existential Subjectivity: A Reconciliation</title>
		<link>http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/?p=227</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction</h3>
I have found it difficult to explain myself to a friend who is admirably and firmly devoted to absolute truth. I am an existentialist, which means in part that I believe truth is subjectivity. This essay attempts to reconcile his ancient canon and my own modern one, and his theory of truth and my own.

If you know this person, you probably have said his name in your mind or out loud already. He is one of the most far-fetched people I have ever known: if you told me about him, I would deny his existence. It is almost a miracle that a person like this could be alive outside of books and ideals, but actually in the world. It is unreal to see his work ethic, range of abilities, and his relentless dedication to virtue and truth. He inspires everyone who knows him. And, of course, he's 17. I am almost terrified to see what he will become, given the rate his ability and virtue accelerate.

However, we seem to disagree on everything. This is for several reasons, but most importantly, it is because our minds are filled with different books. He knows Latin, is well-versed in ancient Greco-Roman literature, and is obsessed with authors like Cicero and Virgil; while I read postmodernism and existentialism, obsessed with such strange names as Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Beauvoir, Levinas, and Zizek. My personal canon is fundamentally different, but perhaps more importantly, the way 'my' authors express themselves is nearly irreconcilable with the way his authors express themselves.

Why are they so different? Modern philosophical authors are responding to a different world. Perhaps a world less pure – or, as I am inclined to think, a world where the impurities are more obvious and easier to criticize. Furthermore, the cultural landscapes of these two worlds have a different topology. The Greeks had no pressing need to respond to Christianity, radical skepticism, rapid scientific progress, mass warfare, the modern nation-state, or the Holocaust, among countless other ideas that simply did not exist in the time of Homer. Would Homer's masterpieces even be recognizable if they were written in the time of Nietzsche? This is a fruitless question. Authors are embedded in their cultural, geographical, and philosophical setting, and they cannot be divorced from it.

But all of this is only polluting fog that obscures the deep-rooted similarities between these authors. Plato and Nietzsche, ancient and modern, are dealing with the same fundamental issue: how to live the best of all possible lives. All else  – metaphysics, epistemology, even ethics – is a distraction to the extent it does not respond to this question. The responses to this are varied, but most of them are similar. I argue that if we view philosophy with the perspective of seeking to gain <em>practical wisdom, </em>which I use in a technical sense, then we should read both the ancients and the postmodernists. Finally, and most importantly, I argue that absolute truth and existential subjectivity can be reconciled and should both be sought after.
<h3>Definitions</h3>
First, let us define truth very broadly. Truth is the set of ideas that both <em>real </em>and <em>virtuous. </em>Neither one of these qualities is sufficient, although both are necessary. For example, slavery is real, but not virtuous; living as if slavery did not exist might be virtuous, but it would not be real. Note that this definition leaves much open to interpretation.

Second, we cannot possibly know truth – ask me or read Plato for the reasons why. However, in most areas, we can know that only one truth exists. For example, either God exists or it does not. Either you should kill a man to save two, or you should not.  In these situations, saying that there are 'multiple' truths would be contradictory – if one statement is true, the other statement <em>cannot </em>be true. Thus, to avoid contradictions, we must accept that absolute truth exists. This creates the agonizing conflict of the human condition: we know that absolute truth exists, but we cannot possibly access it.

Third, what is existential subjectivity? At the outset, I do not argue that truth is subjective. Rather, truth is absolute; there is only one truth. However, as established, absolute truth cannot be accessed. Therefore, we ought to live our lives according to the concept of truth as subjectivity. My definition of existential subjectivity is based on this statement in Kierkegaard's <em>Concluding Unscientific </em><em>Postscript: </em>
<blockquote>Here is such a definition of truth: <i>An objective uncertainty held fast in an appropriation-process of the most passionate inwardness is the truth</i>, the highest truth attainable for an <i>existing </i>individual. (182)</blockquote>
What does this mean? To fully understand, one has to read Kierkegaard. However, in short, it means that

Furthermore, Kierkegaard clarifies the following:
<blockquote>When the question of truth is raised in an objective manner, reflection is directed objectively to the truth, as an object to which the knower is related. Reflection is not focused upon the relationship, however, but upon the question of whether it is the truth to which the knower is related.  If only the object to which he is related is the truth, the subject is accounted to be in the truth.  When the question of the truth is raised subjectively, reflection is directed subjectively to the nature of the individual’s relationship; if only the mode of this relationship is in the truth, the individual is in the truth even if he should happen to be thus related to what is not true. (178)</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>The Importance of Culture in History</h4>
Cultural struggle is the defining force of all human history. This is for two reasons: first, all historical changes have cultural impacts, and second, cultural changes instigate change in all other areas of human life.

The first reason seems obvious, but like all seemingly obvious claims, it must be investigated further. Historical change takes many forms, from the technological to the political. It includes transitions in leadership, construction of buildings, and works of literature. Each of these types of change have spawned whole fields, from art history to archeology. What unites them into a common historical story is one aspect: culture.

For example, introducing a new type of architecture, the castle, transformed European culture. It solidified class structures – overthrowing a feudal lord based in a castle was much more difficult than challenging a tribal leader. No longer could leaders like William the Conquerer sweep across England, claiming new lands and dominating their former rulers with relative ease. It laid the seeds of the nation-state, as leaders established vague borders defined by force and based on the castle. These changes transformed behavior and perception, entrenching the 'culture of the peasant' and the 'culture of the aristocrat.' Additionally, as feudal lands coalesced into countries led by kings, national cultures began to emerge. The impact of the castle cannot be understood without reference to its consequence on culture.

This case is a microcosm for the rest of history. A technological, architectural, or political change is introduced, and it has a ripple effect of cultural changes. I am not proposing that their sole impact is cultural, just that every historical change causes shifts in culture.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been running quite a bit recently and I'm scared.

All too often, I've heard that running is devastating to your joints, causes long-term problems, causes muscle deterioration, and leads to purple tumors on the left side of your knees. How valid are these rumors? For this investigation, I won't simply accept the typical answers of "I read a study..." or "there's an article that says..." or "I promise there's evidence." Instead, I'll dive into the actual scientific examinations of the long-term impacts of running. I need some clear evidence to soothe my psychological fear that I'm killing myself while running. It sure feels like it.
<h3>Effects of Running on the Cardiovascular System</h3>
A famous 2014 study followed 55,000 adults for over 15 years, and found that around 50 minutes of running each week correlates with a 30 percent drop in all-cause mortality risk and an average increase of three years in lifespan (<a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/09/14/493803246/is-running-good-or-bad-for-your-health">source</a>). These results were controlled for all types of running, regardless of intensity, distance, or speed. Persistent runners "had the most significant benefits" with 29% lower mortality from all causes and 50% lower mortality from cardiovascular illnesses. In another massive study with 156,000 subjects, researchers found that men running at least 40 miles a week were 26 percent less likely to develop coronary heart disease than those running just 13 miles per week (<a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/09/14/493803246/is-running-good-or-bad-for-your-health">source</a>). In general, the consensus is fairly strong that running even small distances regularly reduces mortality due to heart disease.

However, there is some evidence that intense endurance training – and by intense, I mean Olympic level – causes health harms. For example, athletes participating in the Olympic games between 2002 and 2008 reported an 8% prevalence of asthma (AHR), which is close to the prevalence in the normal population (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4933620/">source</a>). However, significantly higher rates of asthma were recorded in endurance sports like cross-country skiers (17.2%) and triathlon athletes (24.9%). This correlation indicates that maybe intense endurance exercise increases the risk of asthma. However, if you're not exercising at the intensity of Olympic athlete, you probably don't have to worry too much about the results of this study.

Another investigation declared "long-term excessive endurance exercise may induce pathologic structural remodeling of the heart and large arteries" (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538475/">source</a>). Researchers found that after intense cardiovascular activity like marathons or long-distance cycling, the right atria and ventricle experience overloading that prevents the heart from functioning as well. Normally, these negative effects on the heart disappear after about one week. But after years of repeated stress, long-term defects like patchy myocardial fibrosis and other arrhythmias may appear in the heart.  However, as the researchers admit, "this concept is still hypothetical and there is some inconsistency in the reported findings." When viewed from a lifetime perspective, it's well-established that consistent runners have better health outcomes and lower mortality rates than those who don't engage in frequent intense cardiovascular activity.
<h3>The Impact of Running on Muscles, Bones, and Joints</h3>
Many are concerned that if they run too often, the constant impacts and force on their legs will ultimately lead to arthritis or other joint and bone-related issues. In some cases, this is a legitimate concern. The more you weigh, the more force is applied to your joints when you run. Experts advise that new runners start out slow and work up their mileage as their body sheds weight and adapts to running (<a href="http://www.livescience.com/36241-5-experts-answer-running-bad-knees.html">source</a>). Additionally, if you have a problem that affects your gait, you can harm your legs and joints by running. People with excessive pronators or hyperextending knees are less able to absorb shock through their legs, making running less healthy.

But for most people, running does not negatively affect the bones or joints in the legs, and it does not cause osteoarthritis. Despite the frequent impacts during running, researchers calculated that "the impact forces and stresses acting on cartilage, bones, ligaments, and tendons during running are typically within an acceptable range" (<a href="http://journals.lww.com/co-ortho/Abstract/1997/12000/Impact_forces_in_running.7.aspx">source</a>). A large meta-analysis of studies of osteoarthritis in runners concluded that "long-distance running does not increase the risk of osteoarthritis of the knees and hips for healthy people" who do not have any preexisting medical conditions in the legs (<a href="http://jaoa.org/Article.aspx?articleid=2093294">source</a>). One of the highest-quality studies in this analysis compared 504 varsity cross country runners to 284 varsity swimmers. The researchers wanted to know whether the runners had a higher prevalence of arthritis after 25 years. In the end, long-distance running was not associated with higher incidence of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. In fact, long-distance running might even have a protective effect against joint degeneration, because it increases circulation through the joints and strengthens muscles that prevent joint stress.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
This blog post is very insufficient and it's good if no one reads it. I just wanted to do some research and then collect it in a place where I can reference it later. I feel pretty comfortable with running now.

		<title>Defending Utilitarianism in the Ruins of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This title is as bad as it sounds. Yes, I am going to defend utilitarianism. Yes, in the context of the nuclear bomb strikes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the Second World War. The bombings were unequivocal atrocities. In a better world, the conditions that precipitated them would never exist. But the historical evidence and the ethical arguments leads me to think that the bombings were necessary to avoid even more heinous suffering.
<h3>The meaning of utilitarianism</h3>
An ethical philosophy for large decision-making bodies, especially states,<em> </em>not necessarily individuals. Bring up example of after 9/11, planes were ordered to touchdown, which led to hundreds of deaths - government decisions almost always involve lives lost either way.

Only solution to many ethical quandaries

Arises from the principles that (1) all human lives have value and (2) all human lives have equal value
<h3>Japan in 1945</h3>
<h3>Was peace possible without them?</h3>
<strong>The alternatives</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>US invasion of Japan without nuclear weapons</li>
 	<li>US invasion of Japan with nuclear weapons</li>
 	<li>Blockade of Japan until unconditional surrender</li>
 	<li>Both US and USSR invasion of Japan</li>
 	<li>Voluntary Japanese unconditional surrender in without nukes, invasion, or blockade</li>
 	<li>US acceptance of Japanese conditional surrender after the Potsdam Declaration
<ul>
 	<li>** were the bombs ordered to be dropped <em>before </em>the declaration?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Historical inaccuracies</h3>
After the history, I need to clarify some common inaccuracies.

Many people think that Russia was in the war <em>before </em>the weapons were dropped. In reality, Russia declared war on 8 August 1945, after Hiroshima was destroyed, and a day before the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki.

Japanese did not surrender due to Russian invasion of Manchuria

We did not warn the Japanese using leaflets: http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/04/26/a-day-too-late/,

		<title>A Comprehensive Demonstration of the Harms of Mass Surveillance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Composed by Logan Norris, Jeremy Hadfield, Sean Robinson, and Gabrielle Garner </b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b></b><b>For the International Public Policy Forum</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the topic <strong>Resolved: Mass surveillance is not a justified method of governmental intelligence gathering.</strong></p>

<blockquote>“The most sacred thing is to be able to shut your own door.” – G.K. Chesterton<strong><strong>
</strong></strong></blockquote>
Mass surveillance pervades every aspect of life in the digital age. The global surveillance network, codenamed ECHELON, has fifteen cooperating states and an extensive web of corporate ties and participating programs (Nabbali 2004). These ever-vigilant programs collect trillions of communications annually (Taylor 2014), can now monitor over 75% of the internet (Gorman 2013), and are expanding at a shockingly rapid pace (Von Drehle 2013). There are 30 million surveillance cameras deployed in the United States alone, shooting 4 billion hours of footage every week (Vlahos 2014). John Villesenor recognizes the significance of this: “We are crossing a threshold that has never been crossed in all of human history. It has become possible - even easy...to essentially document everything that has been said and done,” (Goodspeed 2012). Often, the damage that this surveillance creates is downplayed (Heller 2014). It is vital that society recognizes the long-term impacts and consequences of mass surveillance, from the collapse of people-ruled societies to the promotion of conformity, and that its claims at meager benefits are not sufficient to justify its use.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>Framework and definitions: </b>

<b>Justified </b>is defined as shown to be right or reasonable (Merriam Webster 2014). Three tenets that must be adhered to establish justification:
<ol>
	<li>Because mass surveillance is used on an international level, international laws, as represented by the International Covenant on Civil Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, must be adhered to.</li>
	<li>In accordance with the UN’s interpretation, mass surveillance can only be justified if it is proportionate and necessary. If mass surveillance is abused in most cases then it is not justified.</li>
	<li>A cost-benefit analysis, weighing harms and benefits against one another, will be used to determine justification. A cost-benefit analysis is the most useful way to measure the justification of an action (Kee 2014).</li>
</ol>
<b>Mass Surveillance</b> is defined as the pervasive surveillance of an entire or substantial fraction of a population. Surveillance is usually carried out by governments but may also be done by corporations at the behest of governments (U.S. Legal 2014). Mass surveillance can be accomplished through advanced technologies or through spying and police organizations (Cornelius 2004).

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>Mass surveillance increases state opacity and leads to oppression: </b>
<blockquote>“[A] democratic system demands that government be transparent and accountable to the people, not the other way around.” – American Civil Liberties Union</blockquote>
There is not a single country in the world that has a fully transparent surveillance program (Greenwald 2014). With mass surveillance, governments make the affairs of their people completely translucent while they are bound by no standard of openness themselves. These omniscient overseers are free to conduct whatever sort of search that pleases them - unrestricted by the people and behind thorough bulwarks of secrecy.

Mass surveillance programs throughout the world have sacrificed their translucency to prevent national security secrets from entering the public domain. The NSA constructed a highly secretive court, in which “the hearings are closed to the public and the rulings of the judges are classified, and rarely released after the fact,” (O’Neill 2014). The link between mass surveillance and opacity is also evidenced by the increasing opacity of the United States government after the growth of NSA surveillance. In 2013, a record percentage of Freedom of Information Act requests for government files were denied (Bridis 2014). Almost all of the refusals originated from the Defense Department.

Countries such as the United States often hire private contractors to carry out their surveillance work. Currently, 70% of the NSA’s budget goes towards hiring private contractors (Cohen 2013). While the practice is profitable, it reduces transparency, as it is harder to track the work of the contractors and determine whether their work is justified (Thiessen 2013). The people have no oversight or power over these contractors (Goldman 2014).

When there is no oversight over or disclosure about mass surveillance, it’s impossible for the people to make an informed decision about or check the powers of surveillance programs. As James Madison wrote, “a popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy; or perhaps both.” Unchecked government power leads to dangerous excess; power must be checked at every turn, the overwhelming evidence of history teaches us, or people will be abused. Countless regimes have perpetrated mass oppression and genocide because they were not checked by the people (Rummel 1993).

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>The abuse of systems of mass surveillance</b>

Mass surveillance clearly breaks international law. A report given by the UN found that “the States engaging in mass surveillance have so far failed to provide...public justification for its necessity, and almost no States have enacted explicit domestic legislation to authorize its use” (Greenwald 2014).

Furthermore, the harms of a mass surveillance society outweigh the benefits, not just in America, but across the globe. Countries with endemic mass surveillance, such as China, North Korea, Iran, and East Germany give us a lucid view into the detrimental effects of mass surveillance.

In North Korea, citizens are under constant surveillance (France-Presse 2012). Authorities use an extensive network of informants that report individuals they suspect of subversive behavior (HRW 2014). North Korea uses this network to imprison anyone who practices free speech, political opposition, association, petition, or media representation (Winslow 2014). Mass surveillance has allowed North Korea to imprison over 200,000 in concentration camps with a 40% death rate (Amnesty International 2011). Instead of preventing terrorist attacks, mass surveillance turns governments themselves into terrorists that use technology to subjugate their citizens.

Iran has been christened one of the “State Enemies of the Internet” because of its drastic  measures of mass surveillance (Reporters Without Borders 2013). Using various digital forms of surveillance (Alimardani 2014), Iran gravely violates the freedom of information and multiple human rights (Reporters Without Borders 2013). Iran has used mass surveillance methods such as the wiretapping of phones and the monitoring of Internet activity against critics of the Iranian regime (Reuters 2012). Saleh Hamid was beaten with an iron bar by Iranian security agents who claimed that he was spreading propaganda against the regime, using Saleh’s own phone calls as evidence (Stecklow 2012). Anyone who is claimed to be a threat to the authoritarian government may be arrested and sent to Iran’s infamous Evin prison. Journalists, intellectuals, netizens and dissidents are held there for undisclosed amounts of time (Amnesty International 2014). Brutal conditions and horrendous interrogation procedures make Evin a “hell on earth” (Chiaramonte 2013).

China uses its mass surveillance, including over 30 million security cameras, to “crush its critics” (Langfit 2013). China has enacted legislation to secretly hold dissidents who challenge the Communist party (Buckley 2012). The regime used surveillance techniques to find activists and torture them for months in the name of ‘security’ (Lei 2012). For example, Ai Weiwei was held for three months and brutally beaten for speaking against the government (Foster 2014). China now monitors nearly every conversation to intimidate citizens into obedience (Langfit 2013). Chinese security agents can turn cellphones into listening devices, and Li Tiantian, a human rights lawyer in Shanghai, said that they eavesdropped on her conversations to track her movements and arrest her (Langfit 2013).

These despotic surveillance states are unnervingly similar to Western nations that are thought to be more exemplary. Documents reveal that UK and US surveillance agencies have manipulated online discourse in their favor with tactics of deception and repression, infiltrating activist groups with no conceivable connection to terrorism (Aevin 2014). They have targeted political candidates, activists, academics and lawyers (Aaron 2014). Muslim leaders who live exemplary lives have been subjecte

d to intense scrutiny (Greenwald 2014). This surveillance is used to coerce and oppress. For example, in 1963, the FBI sent a letter to Martin Luther King Jr., requiring him to commit suicide to prevent personal information that had been obtained through mass surveillance from being publicized (Corn 2013). Surveillance programs are also used for sheer voyeurism - one NSA employee spied on nine women for six years (Lewis 2013).

As it is used to abuse and silence entire populations, governmental intelligence gathering represents an implement of oppression rather than a benefit.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>How surveillance breeds conformity </b>

A substantial literature manifests that surveillance breeds conformity, silences dissent from state policies, inhibits creativity, and stifles intellectual freedom (Roche 2014; Tolstedt 1984). Using mass surveillance, governments have the power to see how long someone’s attention lingers on a webpage, how she expresses herself in communications, and what kinds of ideas she is being exposed to. This comprehensive data about our virtual persona means that intelligence agencies have an incredibly pellucid view of our minds, second, perhaps, to only ourselves.

One study (“Chilling Effects: NSA Surveillance Drives U.S. Writers to Self-Censor,” 2014) surveyed over 520 writers, and found that because of surveillance, 14% refrained from visiting controversial or suspicious websites, 27% expressed reluctance to write or speak about certain subjects, and 40% were averse to participating in social media. Another inquiry into the effects of surveillance on Internet search behavior revealed a significant decline in searches for sensitive terms after the NSA was publicized (Marthews and Tucker 2014).

These results demonstrate that without the option of privacy, individuals self-censor; they do not express dissenting views, voice opinions, or challenge the status quo. Thus, surveillance is more dangerous, if subtler, than censorship, the removal of an idea after it is expressed: it prevents ideas from ever being expressed. Free minds are key to free societies; anyone must be able to present their conception of the truth (Richards 2013), and surveillance places fetters on the mind, reinforcing compliance to the state and the imperative to act in obedience to norms (Greenwald 2012). This is illustrated by those societies that have fully invested in mass surveillance, such as North Korea, where individuals entirely conform to the government because of its all-seeing surveillance. As Edward Snowden remarked, “Under observation, we act less free, which means we effectively are less free.”

The crippling psychological effects of a watched society are demonstrated by totalitarian nations. A watched society coincides more with a fear-instilling totalitarian regime stripped of rights than a free government. Such regimes have decreased life expectancies, economic growth, and stability. According to Harvard University, citizens in totalitarian regimes experience less individual liberty and political stability; chances of a finishing secondary school are 40% lower, infant mortality is 25% higher, and agricultural yields are 25% fewer. Totalitarian regimes are also more likely to exacerbate terrorism and end up in a perpetual cycle of violence and war (Siegle 2005).

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>Mass surveillance undermines societies</b>

A variety of behaviors key for maintaining functioning societies, such as involvement, cooperation, and well-connected relationships, are undermined by mass surveillance. In post-WWII East Germany, the surveillance agency known as the Stasi established a society where every seventh individual was an informant (Koehler 1999). Here, a single informant was associated with a 10% decrease in organizational involvement (Jacob 2010). The surveillance also had a strong negative effect on social connectivity. In addition, the effects of surveillance remain today: there is a significant economic disparity between East and West Germany, as evidenced by unemployment rates: 13.5% in the East and only 7.2% in the West. This significant imbalance owes to the lingering deficiency in cooperation that is ultimately traced to the Stasi regime’s crushing surveillance (Jacob 2010).

Not only does surveillance damage relationships between individuals, it erodes trust between the state and the people, and between private companies and their customers. This is empirically supported by the explosion of distrust and mass protest that followed the release of the “Snowden files” in the United States (Osborne 2013).

Furthermore, surveillance’s eradication of trust has harmed the economy, especially technological companies. The cloud computing industry alone will lose $35 billion by 2016, and the total profits foregone due to surveillance will be almost $180 billion (Miller 2014). Draconian mass surveillance represses creativity and reduces productivity in workplaces, and both of these are key drivers of the economy (Ovsey 2014). Microsoft labels government snooping an “advanced persistent threat,” a term usually applied to malicious hackers. Experts in technology and the internet are deeply concerned that trust will deteriorate in the wake of mass surveillance (Anderson 2014). Surveillance has also weakened computer systems to gain access to their data, which has harmed the systems comprehensively to great effect on the economy (Holder 2014).

The U.S. has seen a growing controversy regarding its inability to separate systems of mass surveillance from independent legal matters. While many countries preach that mass surveillance is only used to thwart terrorist operations, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration unit and the FBI have admitted that nearly 250 arrests have been made with illegally obtained information, and that they were instructed to lie about its origin (Shiffman 2013). This highlights an example of constitutional abuse and slippery illegal activity that is not proportional or necessary, reminiscent to the despotic Stasi, which expanded into jobs meant for other sectors of the government, “in essence becoming a state within a state” (Knabe 2014). The NSA now has more than 55,000 employees (not including private contractors), as compared to the Stasi’s 91,000 (Groll 2013).

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>Mass surveillance is impotent and counterproductive: </b>

The unprecedented and brutal rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria begs the question: why didn’t the almost completely unhindered surveillance programs of Western nations detect the growing militant movement? The mass gathering of metadata has so far yielded no noteworthy assistance in the effort against the Islamic State, even though it uses the Internet to communicate (Pye 2013). The answer is simple: mass surveillance is inept, and it is even harmful to national security and efforts against terrorism.

An inquiry by the Review Group of the U.S. Federal Government failed to find a single case in which metadata collection provided crucial information in a terrorism investigation (Richardson 2014). In addition, the New America Foundation investigated 54 commonly cited NSA ‘successes’, and found that the agency “played an identifiable role in initiating, at most, 1.8% of these cases” (Bergen et al 2014). NSA director Keith Alexander has admitted that there has been only one terrorist plot in which mass surveillance played a significant role (Brinkerhoff 2013). Government claims about the NSA’s success have repeatedly been shown to be false (Beauchamp 2014).

Private contractors hired by surveillance agencies are not supervised, and thus the national security secrets they manage are at extreme risk. If they release information, it can be exploited by foreign actors for malicious ends. Edward Snowden, who worked for a private contractor, released national security secrets that have been stolen by Russia and China and are now an enormous threat (Dreyfuss 2013).

Moreover, one of the central devices to the rhetoric of those who support mass surveillance is that it will prevent the horrors of terrorist attacks like 9/11 from ever happening again. However, the intensive accumulation of data would not have stopped these massacres, as they resulted from “a failure to connect the dots, not a failure to collect enough dots,” (Medine 2014). Hijacker Khalid al-Midhar’s phone calls to other conspirators were listened to, but intelligence agencies failed to recognize their significance, despite repeated opportunities (Elliot and Meyer 2014). In fact, the sheer amount of data collected by mass surveillance would probably result in the communications between hijackers being lost (Kopstein 2014).

In addition, mass surveillance is, in several ways, counterproductive. Surveillance programs often hack encrypted communications and install ‘back doors’ in internet programs (Sasso 2014). These back doors can be opened by cyberterrorists, allowing them to utilize the government’s methods to wreak catastrophe to the economy and national security of the nation in question. Inserting backdoors, sabotaging standards, and tapping commercial data centers provide malicious actors opportunities to exploit the resulting vulnerabilities (Schneier 2014). With the onset of backdoors created by the NSA, there has been a seventeen-fold increase in the amount of cyberterrorist attacks against the United States (Goldsmith 2013).

Counter-terrorism efforts have been paralyzed by mass surveillance. Knowing of surveillance programs, terrorists have changed their communication patterns to avoid them (Starr 2014). This causes them to “go dark” on surveillance radar, and makes security programs blind to defend against their attacks (Yost 2014).

Furthermore, the abrasion of trust caused by mass surveillance is damaging to counter-terrorist efforts. The recent monitoring of German chancellor Angela Merkel undermined the central pillar of diplomacy: trust (Jeffries 2013). Surveillance demonstrates to Europeans that the U.S. does not act in their interests, but only to further its own international power (Knigge 2013). A strong European-American alliance has been crucial to combating terrorism and working towards stability in the Middle East (Mauer and Möckli 2013). Damaging that alliance will allow terrorism to expand in this already-chaotic area. This is not only an issue of transatlantic diplomacy, however. The injury of trust that surveillance causes will harm relations between all states, leading to an increase in scuffles and perhaps even wars, and thwarting progress towards agreement and peace.

Furthermore, the strategy of mass surveillance is ineffective, as it means that insights are neglected and the amount of spurious correlations found multiplies (Guillart 2014). A small and highly contextual level allows for far more effective intelligence gathering, with fewer mistakes and more results (Friedersdorf 2014). Mass surveillance has had remarkably few successes despite, or perhaps because of, its immense pool of data.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>Conclusion</b>

The inherent nature, negative results, and dysfunctionality of mass surveillance render it a thoroughly unjustified method for governmental intelligence gathering. Mass surveillance requires an opaque and unchecked government that inevitably begins to abuse the rights of its people. It negatively affects the behaviors and relationships of individuals, states, and companies. It is and has been used by international governments to oppress their people. It leads to a collapse of trust and a subsequent fallout in international relations, obstructing the struggle for peace and against terrorism; bolsters conformity; and undermines economic relationships, leading to a decline in overall affluence. Finally, mass surveillance is an impotent and counterproductive strategy of intelligence gathering.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I stare into darkened windows
but cannot find another human.
We move, a machine among machines.
Around me, road billboards preach the cult of a culture
Goods are the gods,
nauseating neon signs the preachers, consumers the congregation.

All this, but still we won't confess
Festering inside modern life is an illusion.
Moldering in our grueling routine
A fungus we never discuss.

I walk as always into the conditioned air and hollow glow
of the store, the temple of lucrative religion.
Around me masses flow into aisles like restless ocean tides
Devout addicts shambling into dope-houses
Monks marching into a well-stocked monastery.
People conditioned to care only for hollow things
They feel the trembling of their lifesprings
In a steady rhythm of income;
They are oblivious to the rhythm of their own hearts.

The market-goers tear designer-made cloth hides off shelves to hide the alienation they feel from themselves.
Across vast ocean their human kin
pour sweat into clothes they could never afford,
shackled slaves of a system they could never share in.
Without thought purchasers
Conscript their currency to the cause of yoking
the scarred hunchback of the slave-world
to the reins of the first world.

This side of the poverty line they trash food they can't sell;
The other side they lash themselves for morsels.
Stores founded by the fortunate, funded by the pain of the poor
But agony is irrelevant when it's on a distant shore.

Rows of pencils adorning lustrous steel shelves hide mirages of massacres.
Rows upon rows of guillotined copses.
Bodies mutilated, piled in the back of a truck.
Bodies of carbon, corpses of trees.
We hoard with the infinite thirst of black holes
But how will we quench thirst from a toxic well?
We're manufacturing our Earth into a gateway to Hell
Greased Gulf oil slicks turn pristine sea into River Styx.
Humanity's a fetus cutting its own umbilical cord,
poisoning its placenta.
Self-immolating before we've realized our potential.
Venomous fumes seethe into filthy atmosphere.
Have we forgotten that we live here?

I leave the temple and feel like I've left a rollercoaster
The world swirls around me as I pass the grocer
In every inch of my vision I see signs of a gangrenous age
Dents in the glaring white walls tell of lives lived.
But I cannot imagine life in this leeching bleached building.
Our stomachs are empty in a cornucopia.
Emaciated in a society saturated by gagging opulence
that seeps into our blackened souls when we cannot see

When the miasma clogs our lungs we will finally realize
Lucre cannot allay the devil's fee.
The only passion I find is confined in synthetic-lit aisles.
I cannot blind myself to the guile in these smiles;
Counterfeit happiness mass-produced in factories.
Everyone I see is decomposing in chains.
Locked up by a desperate desire to devour trivial material.
Will we consume until the will to consume is all that remains?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Maeser Prep Debate / Jan-Feb 2015 / Jeremy Hadfield

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolved: Just governments ought to require that employers pay a living wage. </span></i>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I agree with Martin Luther King Junior that, "an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.” To restructure the system that produces poverty, and for many other reasons, I affirm the resolution: Just governments ought to require that employers pay a living wage. </strong></span>

&nbsp;

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pollin defines the living wage. </span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">Investopedia,. 'Living Wage Definition | Investopedia'. N. p., 2007. Web. 7 Dec. 2014.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>A</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;"> theoretical </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>wage level that allows the earner to afford</b></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #999999;">adequate shelter, food and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the</strong></span></span> other</span> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>necessities of life.</b> </span><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The living wage should be substantial enough to ensure that no more than 30% of it needs to be spent on housing. The goal of the living wage is to allow em</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ployees to earn enough inco</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">me for a satisfactory standard of living. It entails self-sufficiency. </span></span>
<h5><b>I value justice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as implied by “just governments” in the resolution.</span></h5>
<h5><b>My value criterion is maximizing happiness, or utilitarianism.</b></h5>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Respect for human worth justifies utilitarianism.</span> </strong><b>Cummiskey 90 </b>

<span style="color: #999999;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummiskey, David. Associate professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago. “Kantian Consequentiaism.” Ethics 100 (April 1990), University of Chicago. </span><a style="color: #999999;" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2381810"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.jstor.org/stable/2381810</span></a></span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We must not obscure the issue by characterizing this type of case as the sacrifice of individuals for some abstract “social entity.” It is not a question of some persons having to bear the cost for some elusive “overall social good.” Instead, the question is whether some persons must bear the inescapable cost for the sake of other persons. Robert Nozick, for example, argues that “to use a person in this way does not sufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he is a separate person, that his is the only life he has.” But why is this not equally true of all those whom we do not save through our failure to act? By emphasizing solely the one who must bear the cost if we act, we fail to sufficiently respect </strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">and take account of</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> the many other</strong></span> <span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">separate </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>persons</strong></span><b>,</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #999999;">each with only one life,</span> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>who will bear the cost of our inaction.</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> In such a situation, what would a conscientious Kantian agent, an agent motivated by the unconditional value of rational beings, choose?</strong></span><span style="color: #999999;"> A morally good agent recognizes that the basis of all particular duties is the principle that “rational nature exists as an end in itself”. Rational nature as such is the supreme objective end of all conduct.</span> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>If one truly believes that all rational beings have an equal value, then the rational solution to such a dilemma involves maximally promoting the lives and liberties of as many rational beings as possible. </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #999999;">In order to avoid this conclusion, the non-consequentialist Kantian needs to justify agent-centered constraints. </span></span>
<h3><strong>Contention 1: A living wage improves the economy and reduces poverty. </strong></h3>
<strong>Addressing the social problem of poverty is a primary responsibility the state has for its citizens. </strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">Professors Liam Murphy and Thomas </span><b>Nagel</b><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;"> writes that </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">Liam Murphy (Professor of Law and Philosophy at NYU) and Thomas Nagel (Professor of Law and Philosophy at NYU). “The Myth of Ownership: Taxes and Justice.” Oxford University Press (2002)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">Disagreements about the extent of public responsibility are not going to disappear; they are the essence of politics. But we would make the following point: In spite of the disagreements, there is an important area of agreement among those views that take government responsibility for the welfare of citizens seriously. Whether one is a utilitarian or a Rawlsian or a priority theorist, or a believer in a social safety net, or a defender of fair equality of opportunity, or of equal libertarianism, one will be concerned about poverty.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b> Poverty is bad from all </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">these </span><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">points of view. The lives of the poor are hard, humiliating, and dehumanizing; poverty restricts human flourishing.</span> </b><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">However you slice it,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>an increase in the resources of poor people will do more good than a comparable increase in the resources of those who have more</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;"> or much more. That is the most general and straightforward basis for redistributive policies, and it holds in some degree for a wide range of views this side of libertarianism. </span>

<strong>Thus, increases in the well-being of the least well-off outweigh increases in the well-being of the more well-off.</strong>
<h4><b>And a living wage reduces the problem of poverty. </b>Seven reasons:</h4>
<h5><strong>FIRST: States with living wages tend to have more employment</strong></h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">Beth </span><b>Shulman 07,</b><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;"> (Staff, Russell Sage Foundation's Social Inequity and Future Work Project), ENDING POVERTY IN AMERICA: HOW TO RESTORE THE AMERICAN DREAM, 2007, 116.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">In fact, a study by the Fiscal Policy Institute found that</span> <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in 12 states with minimum wages higher than the federal level</span> </b><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">of $5.15 an hour,</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> employment rose more than in states </strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>where the federal level was standar</strong><strong>d.</strong> <strong>This finding held true for small businesses as well. </strong></span><span style="color: #999999;">And why would it not?</span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Workers' increased buying power leads to new purchases, which boost the entire economy </span></strong><span style="color: #999999;">-- and that creates more jobs. It is a virtuous circle, one that helped power the American boom in the </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">years after minimum wages and unionization first swept the U.S. manufacturing sector.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Washington state has the highest wage in the US, and also had the biggest increase in small business jobs last year.</b></span>
<h6><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>SECOND: The academic consensus is that the minimum wage reduces poverty</strong></span></h6>
<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Mike </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Konczal 14, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute</strong></span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">Mike Konczal (fellow at the Roosevelt Institute. His work has appeared in The Nation, Slate, and The American Prospect). “7 Bipartisan Reasons to Raise the Minimum Wage.” Boston Review. March 3, 2014.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would lift 4.6 million people out of poverty.</strong> </span><span style="color: #999999;">It would also boost the incomes of those at the 10th percentile of the income distribution by $1,700 annually. That is a significant benefit for workers who have seen declining wages during the past forty years.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>In a review of the literature since the 1990s, Dube finds </strong></span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>of fifty-four estimates of the relationship between poverty and the minimum wage, forty-eight, or 88%, show that a minimum wage reduces poverty. This reflects a remarkable consensus among economists. The effect of an increased minimum wage on poverty is real, and it would be positive.</strong></span>

&nbsp;
<h6><strong>THIRD: Living wage increases consumer spending, which is the driving force of the economy</strong></h6>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Stephanie Luce, </strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Professor, University of Massachusetts</strong></span> @ Amherst, 2004, Fighting for a Living Wage, p. 15 Joshua Crandall, 2001</span>

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A living wage</span>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #999999;">as opposed to a minimum wage,</span> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>would place more money in the hands of consumers</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #999999;"> (workers), </span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>allowing for an increase in spending</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span><b>The economy's success lies in the ability of products to be purchased.  If workers are paid a living wage</b><b>,</b></span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">around $13 an hour, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>all would benefit</b><b>,</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;"> from the top to the bottom...Faith and labor can work together to pressure our government officials and businesses to put people before profit.</span>
<h6><strong>FOURTH: Reduces the amount of people on welfare, saving billions of dollars for taxpayers. </strong></h6>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Unz 14.</strong> </span><span style="color: #999999;">FORBES.  FEB.11 2014. "Raising the Minimum Wage would Be Good for Wal-Mart and America. <i>Ron Unz is a Silicon Valley software developer and chairman of the Higher Wages Alliance, which is sponsoring a California ballot initiative to raise the state minimum wage to $12 per hour</i></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">The American taxpayer would also be a huge beneficiary. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Each year, over $250 billion in social welfare spending goes to working-poor households</b></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #999999;">via government programs such as Food Stamps, EITC checks, and Medicaid.</span> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As millions of those workers become much less poor, they would automatically lose their eligibility for anti-poverty assistance, saving taxpayers many tens of billions of dollars eac</strong><strong>h ye</strong><strong>ar</strong><strong>.

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #999999;">Similarly, in a study of the impact of the ordinances at San Francisco International Airport, Michael Reich,, Peter Hall, and Ken Jacobs found that despite a significant rise in overall labor costs, there was also a significant decrease in labor turnover.  The direct cost of implementing the ordinance, which was also part of a larger quality standards program (QSP) to improve safety and security while also improving the labor market conditions at the airport, was approximately $42.7 million a year.  Spillover costs to other workers and employers added another $14.9 million to employer costs.  And yet,</span> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>turnover fell by an average of 34 percent among all surveyed firms and 60 percent among those firms where</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;"> average </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">wages had increased by 10 percent or more.</span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">  <span style="color: #999999;">The greatest reduction in turnover, however, was among airport security screeners.  During a fifteen-month period after QSP was implemented in April 2000, turnover fell by almost 80 percent, from 94.7 percent to 18.7 percent.  </span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Every time an a</strong><strong>verage</strong><strong> worker has to be replaced, employers have to pay about 4,275 dollars per worker</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> in turnover costs.  Therefore, as a function of raising wages, employers ended up savings $6.6 million each year in turnover costs.  To the extent that employers experienced reduced turnover costs, they experienced productivity gains.</strong></span>  <span style="color: #999999;">Total observed wages increased by $56.6 million in annual wages for ground-based non-management employees.  </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Many reported that the quality of work increased, and many workers themselves indicated that they were more inclined to put more effort into their work.</strong></span></span>
<h5><strong>SEVENTH: COMPANIES WITH HIGHER WAGES CAN COMPETE WITH Low-WAGE FIRMS BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOWER COSTS</strong></h5>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">In fact, when we did this in Los Angeles </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>we went to a firm that was competing w</b><strong>ith a</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;"> minimum wage firm that was actually getting massive subsidies from the City of Los Angles --</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a very low-wage firm.  The firm we spoke with was paying 30-40 percent above what the low-wage firm was paying its workers.  We asked this high-wage firm how it could survive.  The answer was</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> "<span style="color: #999999;">We survive through having higher morale among our workers."  In specific terms, this meant</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b> t</b></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hat this firm had a low turnover</span></strong><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">of workers quitting their jobs, </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">whereas the firm paying minimum wage had a very high turnover.  The high-wage firm </span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">had almost no absenteeism and</span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">therefore had very low costs </span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">for administering, hiring, and training. </span></strong> <span style="color: #999999;">So, that is another thing that changes when living wages go up -- the "all else equal" condition does not hold. </span></span>
<h3>Contention 2: A living wage reduces income inequality.</h3>
<strong>Income inequality is growing now. Living wage reduces it.</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Owens 13</strong></span>

<span style="color: #999999;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Trumka (president of the AFL-CIO) and Christine Owens (executive director of the National Employment Law Project). “$7.25 an hour is not a living wage.” CNN Opinion. December 2nd, 2013. </span><a style="color: #999999;" href="http://nelp.3cdn.net/1720761e12917005d2_ykm6ivauy.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://nelp.3cdn.net/1720761e12917005d2_ykm6ivauy.pdf</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #999999;"> (CNN) -- For the first time since the Great Depression, the U.S. Census Bureau tells us,</span> </span><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">middle class</span> </b><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">family</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b> incomes have lost ground for more than a decade</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">The sad truth is that the rewards for productivity and hard work such as health care coverage, retirement security, opportunity -- rewards that used to make America's workers "middle class" -- are on the rocks. </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All the wage increases over the past 15 years have gone to the wealthiest 10 percent according to the Economic Policy Institute. All of them. And almost all, 95%, of the income gains from 2009 to 2012, the first three years of recovery from the Great Recession,<strong> went to the very richest 1%.</strong></span></strong> <span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">Something else has happened, too. The bottom has fallen out of America's wage floor. And the erosion of the minimum wage has lowered pay and working standards for all of us. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>An increase in the minimum wage -- which hasn't risen since 2009 -- is long over</strong><strong>due</strong><strong>.</strong> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If the minimum wage had just kept pace with inflation since 1968, it would be $10.77</strong> </span><span style="color: #999999;">an hour today instead of $7.25</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For tipped workers, the rate's been stuck at a scandalous $2.13 for 20 years. </strong></span> <span style="color: #999999;">"It will reduce inequality. The question is how much and for whom. It's not going to have a huge impact, but that's because there's no politically feasible policy that would have a big impact," said poverty and fiscal expert Isabel Sawhill, co-director of the Center on Children and Families at the Brookings Institution.Consider the 5-figure paycheck of a janitor versus the 8-figure salary of a CEO. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25, as a leading proposal in Congress would do, wouldn't narrow that chasm.There's also a big gap between those making 6-figures and the bazillionaires at the very top. A higher minimum wage can't touch that. Then there's the gap between very low-wage and middle-wage workers. It's this gap where advocates say some progress may be made if the minimum wage is raised sufficiently. At its peak in 1968, the minimum wage was equal to 54% of average hourly earnings in the private sector. Today, it comes in at 36%, according to the Congressional Research Service.  </span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"There are a lot of causes of inequality but [the erosion of the minimum wage] is one of the important ones </strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>for inequality at the bottom," </strong></span><span style="color: #999999;">Jason Furman, chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, said this week. Obama, who backs the $10.10 proposal, has said raising the minimum wage would be good for the economy and good for families. A higher minimum wage could increase the pay not only for the 1.6 million workers who earn $7.25 today, but an estimated 17 million workers who make between $7.25 and $10.10. In selling the idea of a higher minimum, though, advocates also say it could result in raises for hourly workers across the board in what's known as the "ripple" effect.</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b> To the extent that the living wage increases the incomes of the poor, it narrows the income inequality. </b></span>

<strong>IMPACT: Income inequality is the most important cause of economic decline and also causes political instability. </strong><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Harkinson 11</span> </b><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Harkinson (staff reporter). “Study: Income Inequality Kills Economic Growth.” Mother Jones.

<span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #999999;">Corporate chieftains often claim that fixing the US economy requires signing new free trade deals, lowering government debt, and attracting lots of foreign investment. But</span> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a major new study has found that</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #999999;"> those things matter less than an economic driver that CEOs hate talking about: equality.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"</strong></span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Countries where income is more equally distributed tended to have longer growth</strong></span><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spells," says economist Andrew Berg, whose </span><a style="color: #999999; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2011/09/Berg.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appears in the current issue of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finance &amp; Development</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the quarterly magazine of the International Monetary Fund.</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b> Comparing six major economic variables across the world's economies, Berg found that equality of incomes was the most important factor in preventing a major downturn</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (See top chart.)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the bailouts and stimulus pulled the US economy out of recession but haven't been enough to fuel a steady recovery.

So how important is equality? According to the study,</span> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>making an economy's income distribution 10 percent more equitable prolongs its typical growth spells by 50 percent. </strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">In one case study, Berg looked at Latin America, which is historically much more economically stratified than emerging Asia and also has shorter periods of growth. He found that closing half of the inequality gap between Latin America and Asia would more than double the expected length of Latin America's growth spells. Increasing income inequality has the opposite effect: "We find that more inequality lowers growth," Berg says. (See bottom chart.). A population where many lack access to health care, education, and bank loans can't contribute as much to the economy. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And, of course, income inequality goes hand-in-hand with crippling political instability, as we've seen during the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya. History shows that "sustainable reforms are only possible when the benefits are widely shared,"</strong></span> <span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">Berg says. "We hope that we don't have to relearn that the hard way."</span></span>

<h3><strong>Contention 3: A living wage increases democracy. </strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Low wages reduce democracy</strong>. <strong>John </strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Heck</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;"> (John, Minnesota 4-H Foundation Fellow at the National 4-H Center, worked for the late Congressman Bruce F. Vento and presently serves on the Saint Paul Charter Commission, publisher) “Minnesota 2020 Journal: Increasing Minimum Wage Increases Democracy” Minnesota 2020 Journal 2014 AT</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #999999;">On Tuesday, inside the State Capitol, Minnesotans rallied for a minimum wage hike. It was a rollicking good time with great speeches, music, call-and-response exhortation and lots and lots of signage. Participants made the case for a minimum wage increase’s positive economic impact on workers’, families’ and communities’ lives. Notably absent from the rally? A lot more</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>minimum wage-earning workers</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #999999;">.</span></strong> <span style="color: #999999;">Why? Because they</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>can’t afford to take the time off from work to advocate for democratic change.</strong> </span>This raises an interesting, troubling question. I<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>f low and modest wage workers are too financially stressed to cast a ballot, attend a community meeting or advocate for policy change, [is the democracy truly representative]?</strong></span> <span style="color: #999999;">resulting elections, meeting outcomes and policy proposals truly representative? </span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Democracy requires citizen participation.</b></span> <span style="font-weight: 400; color: #999999;">We don’t enjoy pure democracy, where everyone gets together and decides everything. In a nation of 300-plus million and a state of 5.3 million, the pure Athenian democracy is functionally unworkable. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Voting participation positively correlates with wealth</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, h<span style="color: #999999;">ome ownership, education and age. Young people don’t vote to the same degree that older people vote. If you’re over 30, own a home, hold a college degree and earn at least the median income, you vote...at minimum wage, is $30. That might not seem like much to folks earning Minnesota’s $57,000 median family income but $30 is ten percent of $300 of weekly gross earnings. Structurally, minimum and </span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>low wage hourly pay reduces the likelihood of participating in voting, advocacy, opposition and the exercise of democracy’s promise. It further concentrates the impact of higher income interests through disproportionately representative concentration. Our democracy becomes, as a result, less democratic.</strong></span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards.</blockquote>
--- <em>Jean Paul Sartre,</em> Existentialism is a Humanism

The more computer science I learn, the more I find myself applying coding concepts to philosophy. I was reading <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm"><em>Existentialism is a Humanism</em></a>, and I realized that variable assignment and function definition could explain the crucial existential concept of "existence precedes essence" in a simple, exact way.
<h3>"Essence precedes existence" in code</h3>
This phrase is the antithesis of existentialism. Here it is in Javascript:

<span style="line-height: 1.6471;">[snippet id="12"]</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.6471;">To people somewhat familiar with computer science, this code can be highly meaningful. The identity is initially expressed in the form of an object. Obviously, a human identity can't be comprehensively written in code. I arbitrarily chose an object to represent human identity. The object </span><code style="line-height: 1.6471;">identity</code><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">, which is outside of the function </span><code style="line-height: 1.6471;">life</code><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">, represents the idea that your identity is defined before your existence. Every aspect of yourself, from your name to your favorite activities to your personality, is constructed in exact detail before you are born. Then, when you begin to live, you start to discover this personality that was already laid out for you. </span>

Most who subscribe to this idea say that God builds your identity, or your identity is defined in some kind of pre-existence. Others say that identity is pre-defined by genetics or human nature. These ideas are all fundamentally the same. Basically, they all express the oft-repeated axioms "Life is about finding yourself" and "essence precedes existence." Someone or something defines your existence beforehand, and then it is passed to the function of life. Sartre explains this best in his <em>Existentialism is a Humanism,</em> so I'll leave the in-depth explanation to him.
<h3>"Essence precedes existence" in code</h3>
<span style="line-height: 1.6471;">[snippet id="13"]</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.6471;">This is a self-executing function </span><code style="line-height: 1.6471;">life</code><span style="line-height: 1.6471;"> in which an empty object called </span><code style="line-height: 1.6471;">identity</code><span style="line-height: 1.6471;"> is first defined and then various attributes are appended to it later in the function. When certain experiences occur, the attributes are appended to the identity. There is a blank array called </span><code style="line-height: 1.6471;">personality </code><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">that has values pushed to it over time. Of course, I didn't express the reality that in human personalities, values can also be overwritten and deleted.</span>

It's interesting to note that since all of these variables are defined within a function, they cannot be accessed by any other function. If someone else had another function for their life, they would be unable to take variables from this function. This code demonstrates the existentialist way of living, which is individualist, self-dependent, and self-defining. This is best expressed by the phrase "existence precedes essence." The object <code>identity</code> first exists, and then it is defined as values are added to it.

This is all a gross oversimplification. I cannot fully express existentialism in a few lines of code, or express all of life as a function. In the end, this post is meant to paint a compelling picture of a more precise way of writing philosophy that can supplement our current literature.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="615"]<img class="" src="http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/20000/nahled/power-of-light.jpg" width="615" height="410" /> <span style="color: #000000;">One of the most commonplace images in philosophy and religion: a light in the darkness.</span>[/caption]

<span style="color: #000000;">In the beginning, there was Plato's cave. There, only shadows without recognizable form existed, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. A prisoner freed himself, and escaped into the light. And he saw the light, and that it was good, and he recognized the origin of the shadows. He returned to the cave of his imprisonment, and said: "Let there be light." </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Entrenched in the core of the Western tradition is the metaphorical narrative of light from the darkness. It is central both in religion, as in Genesis 1, and philosophy, as in Plato's allegory of the cave. I merged these two narratives together to show their fundamental similarity. They describe a myth in which everything is covered in shadow until an enlightened being - God in Genesis and the escaped prisoner in Plato - brings light to the darkness. But where did this metaphor come from? What does it really mean? Is it a valuable metaphor for society, metaphysics, and epistemology? Should we keep it, modify it, or scrap it entirely?</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>A History of Light</strong></span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">The first metaphors of light occur in religious texts. The origin myth in the <em>Rig Veda</em>, a founding collection of Hindu verses written around 1500 B.C., sounds almost eerily similar to Genesis:</span>

<section><i></i></section>
<blockquote><section><span style="color: #000000;">At first there was only darkness wrapped in darkness.</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> All this was only unillumined water. </span></section><section><span style="color: #000000;">That One which came to be, enclosed in nothing,</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> arose at last, born of the power of heat.</span></section></blockquote>
<section><span style="color: #000000;">However, this narrative has one crucial difference from the Bible. In the Rig Veda, one of the most ancient texts ever discovered, heat is the first to come into being, not light. This reveals that until the last century, light and heat were virtually synonymous, because almost all light was generated by fire or the sun. Light and heat are the essence of basic physical comfort. The warmth of the fire provided early humans a refuge from the terrors of the cold, menacing night. Most importantly, it protected us from the fear of blindness. </span></section><section></section><section></section><section><span style="color: #000000;"> In our ancient history, we feared the night not because of the darkness itself, but due to what darkness was associated with: savage beasts, murder, losing one's way. Over time, this dread became so fundamental that we became afraid of the night in itself. The absence of light, became a primary cause of fear, not a secondary terror associated with more dangerous prospects. It is no surprise, then, that the metaphor of light has become ingrained in the human psyche, a permanent relic of more dangerous times. </span></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section><span style="color: #000000;">From the golden age of the Indus valley to the founding of Rome, the world's major religions were hard at work solidifying the metaphorical position of light as good, truth, and piety. The Quran is dotted with the phrase "He bringeth them out of darkness into light." In the Hebrew Bible, John 8:12 directly connects light to God and righteousness:

</span></section><section></section>
<blockquote><section><span style="color: #000000;">When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light<b> </b>of life.</span></section></blockquote>
<section><span style="color: #000000;">In religious iconography from nearly every sect, priests, prophets, and saints are distinguished by a halo of light of some kind. </span></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">The Lighted Clearing: The Epistemology of the Enlightenment</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">The metaphor of light is not merely a decorative literary cliché. "Already in Plato," writes Hans Blumenburg, "the metaphorics of light already has a metaphysics of light implicit in it." The metaphor is at the core of the idea that the world submits itself to the light of reason. Without the language of light-dark duality, it would be challenging to formulate or understand enlightenment philosophy. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">Light-dark dualism is connected with nearly every major European philosophical movement. In Greece, the birthplace of Western philosophy, the Sun was a god - Helios, "the Father of the piercing beams of light" (Pindar). Plato built upon the established iconography of light to represent his epistemology. In </span><em style="line-height: 1.6471;">The Republic, </em><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">light is knowledge, while darkness is ignorance. Daylight exposes the night's filth, untruth, and vice, and therefore light is enlightenment and truth. </span></span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Centuries later, Descartes constructed the philosophical meaning of "the natural light of reason," a phrase coined by Cicero. This light alone, said Descartes, can intuit truth beyond doubt, as it is disconnected from the senses and the corporeal world. In <em>Meditations on First Philosophy, </em>page 14, he writes: </span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">...for I cannot doubt that which the natural light causes me to believe to be true, as, for example, it has shown me that I am from the fact that I doubt, or other facts of the same kind. And I possess no other faculty whereby to distinguish truth. from falsehood, which can teach me that what this light shows me to be true is not really true, and no other faculty that is equally trustworthy. </span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000;">This light, the <em>lumen naturale, </em>is the intuition of truth. Descartes recognizes that reason is not always a meticulous logical process. Often, he writes, it is simply a powerful intuition, a "spontaneous inclination." We <em>feel</em> the logical coherence of certain truths, and we <em>feel </em>dissonance if we reject these truths. He recognizes the flaws of this intuition, but ultimately accepts it as the only method for discovering reality. In the preface to the C<em>ritique of Pure Reason, </em>Kant writes that truth cannot escape the light of reason: </span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">Nothing here can escape us, because what reason brings forth entirely out of itself cannot be hidden, but is brought to light by reason itself as soon as reason's common principle has been discovered. </span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000;"> In short, the radiance of reason exposes all knowable things.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Later in the history of light, Heidegger uses the <em>lichtung, </em>or lighted clearing, as the location where being is disclosed. <em>Lichtung,</em> writes Heidegger,  "designates  a bringing  to  light  which  is  also a  clearing  of  space" (Garbutt). In the <em>lichtung, </em>truths are revealed. It is a site of revelation and exposure, where our inner selves can no longer be hidden.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, most philosophical figures of the Western tradition, including Kant, Plato, Heidegger and Descartes, use a conception of truth best described by the ancient Greek word for truth, <em>alethia, </em>which means "unconcealment." This perspective assumes that everything can be illuminated by light or grasped by reason. This epistemology's foundations are attacked as the postmodernist movement comes into its own. </span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">The Collapse of the Metaphor of Light</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">In the 20th century, postmodern philosophers like Levinas and Derrida recognized that the world is not completely intelligible. By contesting the most fundamental imagery of the Platonic legacy, they are counter-philosophical (Sparrow). These deconstructionists are Simba in the <em>Lion King. </em>They are told that philosophy can understand all that the light touches, but this does not satisfy them. Exploring the borders of the epistemology they inherited, the postmodernists reach the edge of the kingdom and realize that there is existence in shadow and darkness. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The totalizing vision of the Western tradition restricts truth and reality to objects that fit the understandable mold of reason:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;"> "what does not enter into form is banished from this world" </span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000;">(Levinas 1). This vision fails to see that the light of reason can only reveal objective knowledge. <span style="line-height: 1.6471;">The Enlightenment framework assumes that because reason can only understand objective knowledge, objectiv</span><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">ity is the only kind of knowledge</span><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">.</span> In this way, the Platonic legacy ignores subjectivity.  Ironically, the disciples of Enlightenment epistemology are like the prisoners of Plato's cave - they assume that what they can see is all that exists. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">On the other hand, Levinas understood that the most basic fact of our relation with other people is that we cannot understand other people. This is alterity: the infinite otherness of everyone we know. To live is to come into contact with other beings that are fundamentally alien to us, to encounter another consciousness that "wells up inside of us to disrupt and menace the smooth operation of the intellect and the cultivation of a solipsistic identity" (Sparrow). Here, Pythagoras is relevant - in his writings, light represents limits, while darkness is infinity - shadow is associated "with the unexplored, indefinite interior" (Notopulos). Our world, then, is better represented by a dark forest than a lighted clearing. I am subjectivity and I live in the midst of subjectivity - all around me are unexplored selves, and I am an unexplored self. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Derrida made a more political  criticism of light-dark dualism. In George Orwell's novel <em>1984, </em>the protagonist, Winston, is told he will meet his fellow resistor in "a place where there is no darkness." He did not know what this meant, "only that in some way or another it would come true." In the end,  oppressive and all-powerful Party imprisons Winston in a cell where inescapable artificial light tortures him for all hours of the day. This demonstrates the political meaning of light as what allows beings to be revealed, manipulated, controlled, and used as tools toward an end. As Derrida wrote on page 91 of <em>Violence and Metaphysics</em>:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">...the entire philosophical tradition, in its meaning and at bottom, would make common cause with oppression and with the totalitarianism of the same. The ancient clandestine friendship between light and power, the ancient complicity between theoretical objectivity and techno-political possession. </span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000;">Derrida argues that the state cannot possess humans if they do not have the philosophy to justify their act of ownership. This justifying philosophy is the Enlightenment, which views subjectivity as penetrable to reason, and thus open to ownership. Light exposes objects so they can be used, while "A philosophy of the night recognizes that form disintegrates in the darkness, objects lose their graspability" (Sparrow). </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">In absolute visibility, humans become objects. As Foucalt might say, an anatomy textbook exposes the human body completely, which makes the body seem like an object that can be understood if we simply comprehend all the cells that compose it. If we view others in this way, what is the moral significance of owning a human? The state seems to say, a citizen is merely a beast of labor with a different conformation of cells. In reality, we do not encounter the Other as an object, but as an infinite force outside ourselves, with a subjectivity we cannot fully comprehend. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The traditional metaphor of light has failed philosophy. It collapses the moment we step away from our solitary philosophizing and into the world of others. The ancient need to expose, objectify, disclose, and grasp subjectivity causes us to ignore any realities which escape our attempt to understand. We should replace this all-exposing worldview with a philosophy of night that recognizes uncertainty and alterity. </span>

		<title>Ethical Commodities: What Our Products Say About Our Person</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kaepernick-jersey-sales-soar-amid-controversy/story?id=41861482">Colin Kaepernick's jersey is the fifth-most bought jersey in NFL history</a>. Until the events of the last few weeks, the phrase "I bought a Kaepernick jersey" would be meaningless except to a select group of football fans. Now, to wear a Kaepernick jersey is to carry an immense weight, one almost as heavy as a Black Lives Matter t-shirt. Our commodities say as much or more than our speech.
<h3>Ethical commodities and opportunity costs</h3>
I've thought about buying a Black Lives Matter shirt, but realized that in Orem, Utah, I would be labeled, questioned, and possibly even despised for it. I had an intense personal dialogue about this. How can I start a conversation about racism if I don't display my activism? Wait, but don't I support a corrupt capitalist system by buying a shirt through the same companies that run sweatshops and manipulate democracy?

Many of the people I go to school with, and the authority figures in my life, consider Black Lives Matter an anti-white anti-police hate group. When we discussed meaningless activism in one of my classes, someone gave Black Lives Matter as an example in the first sentence - "they're yelling at nothing, like Black Lives Matter." As a self-considered member of the Black Lives Matter movement, for reasons I won't describe now, this is painful to hear. A few words on a ~$10 shirt would affect how people think of me, my relationships with friends and family, and even my self-perception.

I didn't order the shirt - and the reason was economic. It was based on the first bare fact of economics: scarcity, which leads to tradeoffs. As a very poor high school student, I could either buy the shirt, or I could buy a book: <em>Just the Arguments, </em>a book on philosophy. There are countless other ethical opportunity costs in this decision: how can I justify not buying a refugee activism shirt, or giving a donation to the LDS Church, or saving up for a humanitarian trip? Doesn't my decision mean that I value learning about philosophy more than I value black lives?

I'm sure some would incriminate me for being an academic rather than an activist. I love philosophy and want to understand it, but I feel obligated to support resistance against oppression. This is agonizing. How can I choose between movements I'm passionate about? Even worse, how can I choose between them based on <em>money</em>?

Theoretically, people buy a Kaepernick jersey to send a message. It's not just capitalism. Some may say it's a donation, a way to directly support Kaepernick's movement with money. Other justify it as a sign of protest, wearing the jersey to challenge the 'whiteness ethic' that devalues the lives of blacks. In this way, these products can be called 'ethical commodities' - they are products that have intense moral meanings.

<img class="size-medium" src="http://www.stitchedgearshop.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/4/9/49ers_colin_kaepernick_team_color_jersey_for_youth.jpg" alt="It's more than just a jersey. " width="500" height="500" />

There have always been ethical opportunity costs, but the deadly combination of capitalism and the Internet has dramatically expanded the awareness and amount of these opportunity costs. This has transformed nearly all commodities into ethical commodities.

A global economy has connected us, through the allocation of our incomes, to countless ethical implications. The Internet has made us intimately aware of these implications. We can watch Youtube videos of pigs squealing in agony as they are massacred in slaughterhouses, and we cannot help but connect this to our purchase of pork. Nike's swoosh becomes much more symbolic when we see the horrifying conditions of the people who produce it. I could continue listing these implications endlessly. The only escape from the emotional pain of buying products is ignorance.
<h3>How companies and people promote ethical brands</h3>
There are countless ways to rationalize the decision to buy ethical commodities. But from a cynical capitalistic perspective, all of these rationalizations are merely forms of the same aspect of the human psyche: the drive to promote one's personal brand. Our purchases of ethical commodities are similar to marketing decisions: they are meant to convey a message about our brand to a specific group of potential customers.

When we buy a Kaepernick jersey, we want to display our sensitivity to the suffering of blacks in an oppressive system, and we want to display this to a select group of activists. Maybe, on a subconscious level, we promote this ethical brand for profit, so people and potential employers will respond positively. Companies look to hire ethical employees so they can be seen as an ethical corporation. We take advantage of this, for example, by adding our volunteer hours to our LinkedIn profile. According to <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=strict&amp;q=linkedin+1+in+5+managers+hired+someone+because+of+their+volunteer+experiences">LinkedIn itself,</a> "1 in 5 managers hired someone because of their volunteer experiences."

When companies hire people, they hire the full person, not just their competencies. For example, my school, Maeser Prep, looks for a specific kind of teacher with a specific ethical background: deep-thinking, passionate about classical education, usually conservative and religious people.

If we take this perspective to its conclusion, I'm probably writing this essay so people will see me as a better, more enlightened person.

Increasingly, companies use 'ethical marketing' to sell their products. In this way, charities have become tools of for-profit institutions. They are made to fulfill an economic requirement: companies must be perceived as moral institutions. If enough people thought Nike was immoral for its abuses of Indian workers, the company could no longer stay in business. By donating to charity, they expand their moral brand, just as individuals build their moral brand by buying ethical commodities. Malawi's Pizza promotes their product with the claim that some of your purchase will be donated to Africa. In this sense, donations are investments.

To give a current example, Wells Fargo has lost revenue for devaluing the humanities in its advertising campaign. The <a href="https://twitter.com/WellsFargo/status/772177516652003328">company's response </a>was revealing:

<a href="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-04-19.40.53.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-181 aligncenter" src="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-04-19.40.53-283x300.png" alt="Screenshot 2016-09-04 19.40.53" width="283" height="300" /></a>

Wells Fargo counters the ethical challenges to its brand with a powerful marketing claim: it has donated $93 million to humanities. (Although that figure is very vague, and includes donation to 'education' in general). With donations, Wells Fargo justifies its moral failing. It seeks to prove that the 'whole brand' is ethical, and its mistakes are just mistakes in the context of an overall good person. <a href="http://about.nike.com/pages/community-impact">Nike invests 1.5% of its pre-tax revenue </a>(over $217 million) into charity, and has publicized its efforts to protect worker's rights. Why not just stop producing at sweatshop factories? Because<strong> it costs less to promote an ethical brand than it does to be an ethical company.</strong>

All of this demonstrates that<strong> in a society pervaded by capitalism, all activism becomes suspect. </strong><em>Do you really care, or are you just promoting your brand? </em>This isn't just a question other people ask us. It's a question we ask ourselves. Am I a good person, or am I just a brand? How can I know, in a world where everything and everyone seems self-interested? Capitalism calls our moral identity into question and turns the imposter syndrome into a universal affliction.
<h3><strong>The answer? </strong></h3>
I don't know the answer. Of course, there are some easy escape routes, as there always are. However, as usual, these escapes aren't complete, and will never be satisfying.

Consequentialism solves the moral issue of ethical commodities by making intention irrelevant. If self-interest in a certain situation leads to greater happiness, it's moral by definition. I don't have to worry about the imposter syndrome - if I'm doing good things, I'm a good person. It doesn't matter that Nike is reducing its dependence on sweatshops to promote a brand, because it actually has increased workers rights by some degree.

There are some nuances to a consequentialist approach, for example, that consequentialism obligates us to seek for the <em>most </em>ethical system, not just <em>a </em>ethical system. In this sense, the <em>only</em> moral world is the best possible world. Thus, Nike is still immoral because it could conceivably be <em>more </em>moral than it is now. This creates a very high standard - which, I think, is necessary for ethics. Additionally, the world is very complex, and while an act might have certain good consequences, it might also have terrible unintended side-effects.

I don't think I can give a complete refutation of this approach, because to do so would be to offer a final answer to the most debated question in ethics: are intentions or actions more important? Certainly, I think that we can endlessly banter on whether our intentions our correct, when we should focus on the tangible effects our actions have on living beings.

On the other hand, we can't separate our intentions from our actions. Our intent affects how we act - for example, you can't effectively help someone without having compassion for him/her. The person will know that your intentions aren't consistent with your actions, and they'll ignore your insincere approach to service.

Both ideas aren't complete. Intentions are impossible to fully know, and consequences are impossible to fully evaluate. We can't know that someone else is non-genuine, because we can't know that person's thoughts or intentions. I criticized Wells Fargo for its profit-based intention, but I don't know the actual thoughts of the company's decision-makers. We can't say that an action is bad, because we can't know the full consequences of the action. Nike could be immoral for its sweatshops, but maybe it's moral for donating so much to charity. I don't know which of these actions leads to more happiness.

What's the answer? I won't claim that I can construct a complete answer. It's seen as more ethical to be absolute about your ethical system, but how can I claim that I <em>know </em>the right thing in the face of our fundamental uncertainties? I leave the question open, with the hope that someday I'll be able to answer it.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>On Ayn Rand, Selfishness, and Bent Books</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/randbooks.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-201" src="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/randbooks.jpg" alt="randbooks" width="600" height="281" /></a>

Ayn Rand is generally hated by those who consider themselves altruists. This is because the general interpretation is that Rand is a lone mouthpiece for the doctrines of egotism and greed. While some of her arguments are clearly, irredeemably repulsive, such as her romanticization of rape, some areas are more ambiguous, and some segments of Rand's writing are genuinely inspiring and valuable. Despite her flaws, I think Rand should be read and understood, and perhaps even quoted - but never accepted as a whole.

As a caveat, I have only read Ayn Rand's <em>Fountainhead, </em>a few of her essays, and skimmed over the critical response. I'm not a Rand scholar at all, and I'm not sure I want to be. I've heard that the <em>Fountainhead </em>is one of Rand's more mild books, so it may be that my interpretation will change radically when I read <em>Atlas Shrugged </em>later this year.
<h3>Two Types of Selfishness</h3>
There are two archetypes, idealized characters that serve as pinnacles of two opposing moralities, in <em>The Fountainhead. </em>The first is Peter Keating, an extremely 'successful' architect in the sense that he is rich, who graduated at the top of his class from a renowned college and is famous as an architect and celebrity. His life is summarized in this passage:
<blockquote>In what act or thought of [Peter Keating] has there ever been a self? What was his aim in life? Greatness—in other people’s eyes...Others dictated his convictions, which he did not hold, but he was satisfied that others believed he held them.
Others were his motive power and his prime concern. He didn’t want to be great, but to be thought great. He didn’t want to build, but to be admired as a builder. He borrowed from others in order to make an impression on others. There’s your actual selflessness. It’s his ego that he’s betrayed and given up. But everybody calls him selfish. (Rand 65)</blockquote>
In contrast, Roark is an independent architect who was expelled from a major university for not following the widely accepted standards of architecture, and lived a life of poverty because he would only accept work that didn't compromise his standards. He has intractable standards for his work, and is perfectly consistent with these standards:
<blockquote>The creation, not its users. The creation, not the benefits others derived from it. The creation which gave form to his truth. He held his truth above all things and against all men. (Rand 678)</blockquote>
These are the two types of 'selfishness' in Rand's work: selfishness in the form of Keating, and self-reliance in the form of Roark. Rand is an impassioned advocate of the principles expressed by Thoreau in <em>Self-Reliance</em>: “Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind," and "Envy is ignorance, imitation is suicide."

The widespread misinterpretation of Ayn Rand stems from a conflation of the first type of selfishness with the second. In no sense does Rand advocate for selfishness in the form of greed for power, fame, or money. In fact, much of the book is focused on criticizing Keating's mindless, 'selfless' greed. Rand analyzes the psychology of avarice, and the perverse pleasure Keating feels when he exercises power over others -<span style="font-weight: 400;"> "he had influenced the course of a human being, had thrown him off one path and pushed him into another" (67). This type of selfishness is contradictory in the sense that it cannot exist without others. It is entirely dependent. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When Keating didn't have people to approve of his work, he didn't have a way to value his work: "...it might be good. He was not sure. He had no one to ask" (Rand 171). Keating's eminence dissipated when his admirers disappeared. "He was a great man - by the grace of those who depended on him" (Rand 233). This passage eloquently epitomizes this fundamentally dependent form of selfishness: </span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">"He was great; great as the number of people who told him so. He was right, right; right as the number of people who believed it. He look at the faces, at the eyes; he saw himself born in them; he saw himself being granted the gift of life. That was Peter Keating, that, the reflection in the staring pupils, and his body was only its reflection." (Rand 188)
</span></blockquote>
In contrast, Roark might be seen as ideally self-reliant. His work is his passion, and his system of valuation stems from his self - the Fountainhead. Everything else is external and unessential. Others are a means to fulfill his standards: "I don't intend to build in order to have clients. I intend to have clients in order to build" (26). He is, in short, the polar opposite of Keating in every way.

It is valuable to distinguish self-reliance, from selfishness, and this is the most important principle of <em>The Fountainhead: </em>"The choice is not self-sacrifice or domination. The choice is independence or dependence" (681). We shouldn't need to ask another whether our work, our thoughts, our actions are valuable  - ultimately, only we can evaluate ourselves. Our attempts to delegate the choice of what to value ultimately collapse. When we ask another for advice, we choose to ask them rather than others because we seek a certain answer - thus, we are still making a choice. Furthermore, our interpretation of any advice is a choice. Advice is an illusion - all valuation stems from ourselves, and we cannot give this responsibility to another.

Now that we understand this distinction, it's time to criticize Rand. Hopefully there is something valuable left when we're finished.
<h3>The Collapse of Rand's Morality</h3>
On any level of analysis beyond the literary, Rand's moral system, if it can be called that, is pathetically inadequate. Her 'ethics' are summed up by Howard Roark’s statement in <em>The Fountainhead</em>: "All that which proceeds from man's independent ego is good. All that which proceeds from man's dependence upon men is evil" (681). Like most generalizations in ethics, this claim collapses upon inspection. It requires an idealism divorced from reality, is riddled with paradox, and leads to appalling conclusions.

First, to Rand, any relationship with others is merely a means to an end - "To a creator, all relations with men are secondary" (680). This is fundamentally counter-ethical, as it treats the only relevant moral object as the self and the fulfillment of the self's standards. Morality must deal with the conflicts of obligations between multiple selves, not just the interests of a single self. Rand entirely ignores the Other, and thus she does not really have an ethics.

Rand fails to have an ethics in a second way. She describes the need to have consistent standards, but does not discuss what these standards should be.
Keeping one’s standards is necessary, but not sufficient, to be moral. For this principle fails the standard litmus test of morality: Hitler and the Holocaust. If standing by your standards is all is required to be moral, then it seems that Hitler is a paragon of morality. After all, Hitler staunchly upheld his monstrous standards. As a Jewish character in Elie Wiesel’s novel Night said,
<blockquote>I have more faith in Hitler than in anyone else. He alone has kept his promises, all his promises, to the Jewish people. (67)</blockquote>
He did whatever he thought was necessary to keep these promises, and he killed himself before he would forsake the struggle.

Clearly, there is more to ethics than just consistency. The other fundamental aspect of being moral, and the more difficult one, is to develop good standards.

Third, ethical solipsism is contradictory.  If I believe that my own interests have value, and I believe others have the same fundamental, human characteristics as myself, then it follows that the interests of others must have value as well. If I accept this syllogism (I do), it becomes impossible to logically maintain the belief that only my own interests have value. Rand provides some  insight onto how one should live one's own life as an independent will, but she is almost completely absent when we inevitably encounter others.

Fourth, lived experience obstructs any effort towards egoism. To paraphrase Levinas, we do not encounter others as objects, but as infinite subjects that we cannot understand, who call out to us and require us to respond. We cannot maintain egoism when we encounter the other. For me, this encounter happened in India:
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we drive, I see a body without limbs, lying in an alley ahead. The rickshaw rattles forward, and the engine pulsates like the heart of a dying man. As we pass the corpse, it moves. It contorts its neck to look up. For a second I see his scarred, filthy face and he sees my washed one. In that instant of connection, my lifetime became worthless. My childhood had been a solipsistic simulation, a life without impact or any real need.  </span></blockquote>
It is impossible, and fundamentally unethical, to live as if others do not exist or do not have morally relevant interests. Life is a matter of interdependency: we are raised by parents, mentored by teachers, taught by the minds that came before us, and forgiven by those who love us. If we believe that these experiences are valuable for ourselves, it must follow that they are valuable for others. Thus, we have an obligation to do the same for others.
<h3>Rand on Romance: Love as Domination</h3>
The relationship between Howard Roark and his lover, Dominique, is abhorrent. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominique falls in love with Roark primarily because, as she says, he was the "abstraction of strength made visible" (Rand 205). She seeks to be dominated by him, but she also seeks to find some way in which she can own him - "She thought suddenly that the man below was only a common worker, owned by the owner of this place, and she was almost the owner of this place" (205). Roark rapes Dominique*, and there is a horrendous, <em>Fifty Shades of Grey-</em>esque response: "She found a dark satisfaction in pain - because that pain came from him" (209). Dominique's only compensation is that she is also in a position of power: "she knew the kind of suffering she could impose on him" (210). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love in <em>The Fountainhead</em> is reduced to essentially a power relation, and almost all affection between Roark and Dominique consists in a struggle for power.</span>

I almost stopped reading the book after these chapters. It would be too far to say that Rand redeems herself later. I would only say that she manages to contradict herself. As the relationship between Roark and Dominique matures, they begin to recognize their dependence on one another:
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was strange to be conscious of another person's existence, to feel it as a close, urgent necessity; a necessity without qualifications. (Rand 218)</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is love as, well, love - interdependence, relying intimately on someone else without being controlled by them. It is needing another "in the total, undivided way...the kind of desire that becomes an ultimatum, 'yes' or 'no', and one can't accept the no without ceasing to exist" (Rand 502). Surprisingly, Rand has common ground here with Levinas, the radically altruist philosopher:</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love remains a relation with the Other that turns into need, transcendent exteriority of the other, of the beloved. (Levinas)</span></blockquote>
This is love not just as a choice or a desire, but as a need.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
However, I am cherry-picking Rand. In context, her quotes are much less redeeming. In the same conversation that Roark describes love as an 'ultimatum,' he says: </span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love you so much that nothing else can matter to me, not even you. Can you understand that? Only my love -- not your answer. (Rand 502) </span></blockquote>
Roark argues that love itself is valuable, regardless of whether the love is reciprocated. This, of course, justifies rape. Without the other, what is love? It is merely possession of an object. After all, "If one could possess, grasp, and know the other, it would not be other" (Levinas). If we accept Rand's perspective, the people we love are only alter-egos or figments of our own ego; they have no consciousness of their own, and can only be defined in the context of our self.

However, love can only be understood as a relationship between two subjects, and when either is treated as a means or as an object, the bond dissipates. What constitutes love is reciprocation - without this, it is only domination.
<h3>Aesthetics of the City</h3>
<a href="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/city2newyork.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-197" src="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/city2newyork.jpg" alt="city2newyork" width="1920" height="1200" /></a>

As <em>The Fountainhead </em>is a book about architects as well as a book about philosophy, it asks and answers several aesthetic questions, especially the foremost one: "What is beautiful, and why?"

I have always thought that nature is beautiful. I spend a lot of my free time exploring the mountains, usually on a bike. To some extent, I do this as an escape from the city. Most people would agree that the city is ugly, a scar on the land, a destruction of beauty. However, when describing the experience of looking up at a skyscraper, Rand argues that the city, the product of human creativity, is aesthetic:
<blockquote>It makes him no bigger than an ant--isn't that the correct bromide for the occasion? The God-damn fools! It's man who made it--the whole incredible mass of stone and steel. It doesn't dwarf him, it makes him greater than the structure. It reveals his true dimensions to the world. What we love about these buildings, Dominique, is the creative faculty, the heroic in man. (553)</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lookingupcity.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-195" src="http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lookingupcity.jpg" alt="lookingupcity" width="960" height="640" /></a>

The fact that humanity created these magnificent buildings is itself beautiful, and these buildings represent this fact. They stand as a testament to our potential. If this is the case that the city can be beautiful, and beauty is worth protecting, then we have an obligation to protect the city through urban development, restoration, and preservation, just as we have a more widely-accepted obligation to protect nature. Now, I do not go into the mountains just to escape the city, but to discover and re-experience a different dimension of beauty.

We often think that what makes something beautiful is that it draws our gaze upward, but perhaps this is not the case: "He wondered whether the particular solemnity of looking at the sky comes, not from what one contemplates, but from the uplift of one's head" (Rand 553). The sky itself is not what is beautiful, but our desire to understand the sky, to reach towards and above it. What creates beauty is not the object's attraction, but the way we are inspired by the object to achieve our potential.

<h3>Should we read or reject <em>The Fountainhead? </em></h3>
Daniel Taylor, author of <em>The Healing Power of Stories,</em> defines a 'bent book' as a story that portrays evil as good and good as evil (Taylor). He ultimately concludes that we should never read bent books. There are several problems with this binary.

First, of course, it presumes that we already know what is good and what is evil, an assumption that skips over all the dilemmas of ethics. Often, we read to seek after good and reveal evil in their hiding places - but we do not already know where they are hiding when we start. Reading is not just a process of reinforcing our standards, but of developing our standards. It would be dogmatic and arbitrary to automatically reject all books that seem bent, and it would presume that we are an absolute moral authority that has the ability to judge objectively whether a book is good or evil.

Second, it is not necessarily true that bent books will result in greater evil. Before I read <em>The Fountainhead, </em>I assumed that morality consisted of interdependence and altruism, merely because this is the most common conception of morality. Ayn Rand forced me to analyze and justify this belief. This is essential, for any belief we have justification for has more binding force than a belief we merely accept. Furthermore, through bent books like <em>The Fountainhead, </em>we are able to recognize the reverse of our values. If we begin to see this perversion arise in ourselves, we are able to root it out immediately. Thus, bent books encourage us to define ourselves in contrast to evil, thus promoting ethics.

Finally, the book has certain areas that vindicate its failures. It has an excellent and unique style of writing and storytelling, and this itself is valuable, for our method of expression can be almost as important as our content, and reading good writing allows us to write well. Even much of the content of <em>The Fountainhead </em>is worthy - this, I guess, can only be verified by reading the work yourself. In the end, scenes of wickedness are not enough to invalidate a book. As Leonardi Bruni argued, the Bible contains scenes that are "wicked, obscene, and disgusting, yet do we say that the Bible is not therefore to be read?" (Gamble 341).

I don't contest that <em>The Fountainhead </em>is bent, rather, I think that bent books should still be read, as long as they have redeemable qualities. However, if you want to read more from <em>The Fountainhead</em> without reading the 'bent' parts, check out my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cI3ouRF0xiHZ4PL5S2PzCr3MSwNxdHsekwyqgEWcioY/edit?usp=sharing">notes on Google Drive.

		<title>What Matters in a President, and Why Electability Doesn&#039;t</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm not going to argue for any of the candidates in this post. That'll come later. For now, I think there are three main factors that should be considered in a president. They are all interrelated, and in order of importance. However, if a candidate doesn't meet any one of these criteria, it is practically impossible to meet any of the other criteria.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Character - </strong>This consists mostly of the the moral standards and honesty of the candidate. If I do not trust a candidate, their competence becomes irrelevant, as it will not be used ethically. Their positions become meaningless because they will abandon policy and ethical standards at will. Character also includes temperament and personality, as an angry, irrational, and unstable candidate is a danger to the world and ineffective in diplomacy.</li>
 	<li><strong>Competence </strong>- The proven experience of the candidate, their intelligence, and their ability to implement policies effectively. If a candidate isn't politically competent, their policies won't matter because they will never be implemented. Intelligence is not measured by IQ, but by the candidate's understanding of the world, their rationality, their education, and their working ability.</li>
 	<li><strong>Policy </strong>- The stated positions of the candidate. If every candidate could be trusted to follow their policy statements exactly and implement them effectively, this would be the only issue. Despite its importance, policy is <em>by far</em> the least-discussed issue in this election.</li>
</ol>
<h3>On Electability</h3>
Electability, for me, is mostly a non-issue. Of course, a candidate must have some chance of becoming president, or we will be divided into minuscule factions and candidates will only have to win a small portion of the vote to take the election. However, "some chance" is a low margin. For example, Zoltan Istvan, the transhumanist candidate, is not on the ballot in any state and is not polling at more than 5% in any state (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/06/15/zoltan-istvan-2016-lets-make-americans-immortal/85929946/">source</a>). This is below the "some chance" margin, as 25 days from the election, he has no path to the presidency. However, Evan McMullin, an independent candidate, is on the ballot in 11 states (<a href="https://www.evanmcmullin.com/how_to_vote_for_evan">source</a>), has a significant chance of winning Utah (<a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865664606/Poll-Trump-falls-into-tie-with-Clinton-among-Utah-voters.html">source</a>), and has a growing campaign nationally. If a candidate passes this minimum threshold of electability, we should move on and consider the three most important factors.

Our democratic obligation is to vote for the candidate we support. Otherwise, our system degrades and no longer represents the population, as the contemporary philosopher Slavoj Zizek described:
<blockquote>We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligence to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be.</blockquote>
If we do not vote our conscience, we as a population fail to represent ourselves. We do not 'throw our vote away' when we vote for an unlikely candidate we genuinely support, rather, we throw our vote away when we do not vote what we believe. We are not voting for ourselves, but for someone else, for the polls, for the average. Popular opinion becomes the popular opinion of what the popular opinion is; democracy devolves into regressive guessing at the average. Furthermore, government is only legitimate when it represents the governed. When we do not represent ourselves, our government becomes illegitimate.

Finally, there are a ton of misconceptions about voting power in our democracy.

First, <a href="https://fee.org/articles/how-not-to-waste-your-vote-a-mathematical-analysis/">statistical analysis</a> shows that, in general, your vote has the most power if you vote for a third-party candidate, not for a major party. I don't really see the point of explaining this, as the linked post explains it <em>very </em>well. I'd definitely recommend reading it.

Second, the power of a single vote is extremely close to zero. This election, your vote will probably be around 1 in 125 million. Therefore, the best reason to vote is not really to control the election, but to represent ourselves. Don't do it merely for the results; do it because you believe in your candidate.

Third, a lot of the time, your publicly expressed opinions matter more than your vote, because these opinions influence a significant amount of votes. Who you support actively matters more than who you vote for quietly.

Fourth, whether or not your candidate is elected is not the only measure of voting power. You could say all the Bernie Sanders votes this year were wasted because he didn't win, but he still radically influenced the election and changed American politics permanently. Winning ≠ success.

Fifth, when you vote for a third party candidate, you break out of the mold. This draws attention far more than obediently voting for established candidates that adhere to the two-party system. Therefore, votes for a third party candidate are more influential than other votes.

That's why I don't think electability matters, and why don't think it should matter. Vote your conscience this election.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I love it because it juxtaposes absurd, delusional people against unabashed authenticity. This comparison isn't exactly subtle, but it is never explicitly said. Jim and Pam become protagonists not because they receive the most screen time, or the story is told from their perspective, or they overcome all their challenges and become exceptional - rather, it's precisely the opposite. They aren't heroes. They are merely authentic, and we can only relate to them because they are the only real people within this office landscape of hollow appearances.

Michael's relentless scrambling to avoid blame, display virtue, and underscore his importance always fall flat. Usually, episodes end with a convoluted explanation from Michael about how he didn't really fail, how he wasn't really a bad person. The actual events of the episode, though, create a cringeworthy irony. Michael is never outright condemned as a hypocrite, but he is painted as one by the contrast between his own words and reality.

Dwight indefatigably grapples with the pain of an uncertain existence, where unfortunate realities can't simply be labeled 'false.' He struggles to reconcile lived experience and his emotions with the theoretical constructs he has used to rigorously define the world. For example, he completely misses out on the party while examining the construction of the house. He ignores lived experience if it does not fit his hypothetical framework.

Inauthentic people – and by that, I mean people in general – use elaborate schemes to portray themselves in certain ways and ignore others. In<em> The Office,</em> these schemes are almost as obvious, hilarious, and pathetic as they are in the real world. <em>The Office </em>just points out how funny and cringey they are, usually through Jim or Pam. Now back to binging <em>The Office. </em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems undeniable that the specter of fake news has taken control of the media. It seems that we’ve now entered a dark age of journalism, where the fake is indistinguishable from the real. It seems that we have entered an unprecedented era of hoaxing and counterfeiting. </span>

<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://missiongalacticfreedom.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/fake-news-sites.jpg?w=681&amp;h=377" width="681" height="378" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But journalism has never been free of fake news. The Columbia Journalism Review published a </span><a href="http://www.cjr.org/special_report/fake_news_history.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">detailed history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of fake news in the United States. In short: fake news isn’t new, and it has real impacts. For example, people fled the city in droves and marched into public parks with guns after the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Herald </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">published a fabricated report that dangerous animals had escaped the zoo. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And fake news existed even before Gutenberg invented the printing press. In 1475, an Italian preacher claimed that Jews had drunk the blood of an infant (</span><a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/fake-news-history-long-violent-214535"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). This led a local Bishop to order the arrest of all local Jews, and fifteen Jews were burned alive. The fake story spawned even more hysteria about vampiric Jews, which spread across Europe despite declarations from the Pope to try and end the panic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fake news has unbelievable power. In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journalism: A Critical History, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin Conboy demonstrated its dramatic role in history. In 1898, the USS </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maine </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exploded off the coast of Havana, killing over 250 people. The cause was never explained. The Spanish government, which controlled Cuba, expressed sympathy for the disaster and denied any involvement. The captain of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maine, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the few survivors, urged Americans to withhold judgement to prevent conflict with the Spanish.</span>

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="857"]<img class="size-full" src="http://revolutionsincommunication.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/uss_maine_lying_headline.jpg" width="857" height="1096" /> The headlines after the Maine explosion – based on fake news.[/caption]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, Joseph Pulitzer, editor of the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New York World, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly condemned Spain, claiming that they sabotaged the Maine. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">World </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">published a cable showing that the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maine </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was not an accident – even though this cable was completely fake. Newspapers published imaginary drawings of the explosion – even though no one had seen it.  Sales of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">World </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">skyrocketed, and the public demanded revenge. Fake news helped start the Spanish-American War. Maybe we shouldn’t be surprised that the namesake of the highest award in journalism, the Pulitzer prize, was a purveyor of fake news. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So is there anything new about the recent fake news? Yes – because Americans are far more dependent on news. News, both print and digital, takes far more forms than at any other point in history – videos, images, blogs, tweets, posts, articles. Almost all Americans can read basic English (</span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs93/93275.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), 84% of Americans use the internet (</span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/06/26/americans-internet-access-2000-2015/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and 79% of American internet users are on Facebook (</span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/11/11/social-media-update-2016/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Never before the last decades has the vast majority of the population been simultaneously connected to a source of instant news. A meme, story, or fake event can spread across the public awareness in a few hours. The fundamental nature of fake news hasn’t changed. It has just become far more common and accessible – just as the modern transportation system allows viruses to spread far more quickly.</span>

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1429"]<img src="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Geo_map.jpg" width="1429" height="583" /> A map of global disease spread – not too far from the transmission of fake news.[/caption]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, perhaps the American public has become increasingly vulnerable to fake news. While this claim is hard to demonstrate and somewhat unverifiable, it’s possible that the average reading level has declined. In 1776, the relatively complex, sophisticated pamphlet </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common Sense </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold 500,000 copies, roughly 20% of the colonial population (</span><a href="http://freakonomics.com/2011/09/01/were-colonial-americans-more-literate-than-americans-today/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Now, less than 13% of Americans are proficient in “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reading lengthy, complex, abstract prose texts” like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common Sense </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/naal/kf_demographics.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). It seems that the percent of Americans who can understand </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common Sense </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is smaller than the proportion that owned Common Sense in 1776. Plus, the most recent studies show that American reading proficiency has declined over the last two decades (</span><a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-american-adults-have-low-and-declining-reading-proficiency-20131008-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Even among college graduates, the proportion that can understand and reason about complex texts has decreased to less than 31% over the last decade (</span><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/24/AR2005122400701.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a viable theory that these two trends – increasing access to news and decreasing reading ability – have shaped a perfect storm for fake news. Americans aren’t as likely, or as able, to make nuanced, reasoned analyses about complex texts. They’re more likely to have access to the oversimplified and sensationalized world of internet news (and news in general). More people can be infected by the virus (fake news), and less people have the vaccine (critical thought). As a result, a single tweet can spawn a flurry of fake news that quickly becomes an accepted part of the American psyche. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the concept of fake news is also dangerous in other ways. It has already been used as a political weapon to shut down opposing journalism. The left has used it to deride right-wing sources, and the right has coopted it to attack left-wing news. Already, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">LA Times </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">claimed that right-wing sites like the Ron Paul Institute and Breitbart.com are ‘fake news’ (</span><a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/media/310228-hunt-for-fake-news-is-the-new-mccarthyism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These sites could be derided as biased producers of dangerous propaganda, but this is not the type of fake news I’m interested in. Breitbart may be skewed, but it does base news loosely on actual events. Fake news is completely counterfeit – without referent in the real world. To avoid ‘fake news’ becoming a tool to eliminate enemy voices, we need to delineate the concept clearly and create solutions carefully.</span>

This is an intro to some of my further research into fake news. This week, I’m going to write another article about the philosophy of fake news, and then one about the solutions to the problem. I’ll try to relate the issue to Baudrillard’s theory of hyperreality, examine the differences between Kantian and utilitarian journalistic ethics, and look back to Plato’s critique of postmodernism. Maybe I’ll even make up some ideas of my own.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Why am I so interested? I think that fake news is a microcosm into the larger issue of the ‘postmodern condition,’ which is what I’m focusing on for my three-week independent study. It relates to the need for classical education, which is what I’m studying in a directed readings class. And it’s a good area for philosophical research that hasn’t been fully delved into. </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Fetishization of Individuals: From Hitler to Ken Bone</title>
		<link>http://www.jeremyhadfield.com/fetishization-individuals-hitler-ken-bone/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Humans have a relentless tendency to treat individuals as microcosms for the world. If we can identify a certain individual who fits into a group, we generalize this individual and make him/her representative of the group or concept as a whole. When we speak about these concepts or groups, we are implicitly thinking of these fetishized individuals. Thus, the 'philosopher' becomes Plato; the 'drug lord' becomes Pablo Escobar; the 'autocrat' becomes Hitler. These people that stand as concrete symbols for entire ideas are what I call 'fetishized individuals.'

There is a constant political battle for control over these fetishized individuals. If someone humanizes and normalizes Pablo Escobar, they successfully humanize and normalize the drug trade as a whole. They take control of the image of the drug trade – the vivid, personalized, and individual representation. Then, when someone thinks of the drug trade, they think of Pablo Escobar – the friend of the poor, the anti-corruption, anti-communist activist, the family man.

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1500"]<img src="http://cdn-r2.unilad.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/escobar3.jpg" width="1500" height="2149" /> Pablo Escobar as a criminal – the negative fetishization of a drug lord.[/caption]

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="290"]<img class="size-full" src="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-67bfbc93b2b855542247fc8e6a46acde-c?convert_to_webp=true" width="290" height="173" /> Pablo Escobar with a child – the positive fetishization of a drug lord.[/caption]

When another representation is introduced, it is considered in the context of the existing fetish. Thus, it is extremely difficult to argue that El Chapo is terrible to convince someone who has internalized a positive version of Pablo Escobar as the representation of drug lords. Any logical argument is subordinate to their personal ideology-based 'experience' of Escobar. Perhaps a poor man heard Escobar gave out money in the streets and built schools for the impoverished; this gives them an emotional attachment – a fetish in a non-sexual sense – to the narrative of Pablo Escobar.

Modern political conflicts have begun using fetishized individuals in more obvious ways than ever before. The most clear example of this is Hitler, for he is the most completely fetishized person in the world. For almost everyone with an elementary education, mentions of autocracy, fascism, dictatorship, and genocide generate immediate images of Hitler with arm raised. One cannot win the ideological battle of making autocracy acceptable until one has made Hitler acceptable.

The first ideological step of neo-Nazis, therefore, is making the fetish of Hitler positive. This can be done in a variety of ways. For example, the extreme right-wing and anti-semitic site Rense.com published a series of images of <a href="http://www.rense.com/htlr/htlrhuman.html">the 'hidden' Adolf Hitler.</a> Using these images of him – holding children, walking in gardens, smiling – makes it much harder to imagine him other contexts. We find it conceptually difficult to unite the many disparate aspects of a person into a single unified identity. How could the same Hitler that ordered the Holocaust also kiss babies? <a href="http://phys.org/news/2015-06-cognitive-dissonance-ingrain-political-attitudes.html">Psychological research</a> shows that cognitive dissonance like this causes tangible pain. The drive to eliminate the dissonance, then, leads some to fetishize Hitler in a wholly positive way.

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="416"]<img src="http://bound4life.com/blog/system/files/318/original/hitler_baby.gif" width="416" height="330" /> A positive fetishization of Hitler[/caption]

The Netflix original <em>Narcos </em>powerfully represents our difficulty in categorizing individuals. You see Escobar in a variety of contexts – at home with his family, in drug labs, on a farm working, and at war. It becomes difficult to remember his horrific crimes when he is watching clouds with his young children. We can't really conceptualize a 'whole' person – only the person we are seeing at the time. Uniting all the different Escobars into one unified individual is almost impossible. Ideologies take advantage of this inability to unify, and summarize individuals by a single aspect. For some, the need to resolve cognitive dissonance means forgetting Escobar's crimes to enable a positive fetishization of his figure.

In the most recent presidential elections made fetishization a key aspect of political strategy. In 2008, Samuel Wurzelbacher asked Obama a simple question about small business tax policy – almost instantly making him a key symbol of the presidential election. He mentioned something about wanting to buy a plumbing company, and the McCain campaign leaped at the chance to relate to an 'ordinary American.' They coined his new name – Joe the Plumber – and repeatedly used him as an example in campaign rhetoric. McCain used the symbol of Joe the Plumber to show that Obama was 'out of touch with the average Joe.' It didn't matter that Samuel wasn't really a plumber and his name wasn't really Joe. <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Throughout the campaign, writes Amarnath Amarasingam, “A fictional plumber’s false scenario dominated media discourse" (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11150992-the-stewart-colbert-effect">source</a>). </span>

In the modern election, it seems that the myth of the ordinary Joe has taken hold even more firmly. America has a need to believe in the normal citizen, a 9-5er who wants only find his dreams, stick to his moral standards, and support his family. And yes, this citizen is a he – we seem unable or unwilling to use a female figure as a symbol of American life.

Why do we feel a drive for the ordinary? After all, we are obsessing over the nonexistent. There is no 'ordinary Joe.' Every citizen has quirks, mistakes, sins, hidden lies, and extravagant dreams that prevent them from being ordinary. Joe can only exist as an idealized symbol, not a concrete individual. And yet the idea of the ordinary citizen is permanently entrenched in our minds. In some way, many people aspire to be average. This aspect of the psyche creates political battles over the ability to protect the ordinary individual, who stands as a metaphor for the whole American citizenry.

Thus, Ken Bone was created. He was a symbol of an ordinary person – appropriately but not excessively involved in politics, working the day job, dreaming small dreams, providing for the family. He was 2016's version of 2008's Joe the Plumber. He represented s<span style="font-weight: 400;">imple authenticity, the everyman – as his Twitter profile proclaims, he is merely an “average midwestern guy.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He did not decide to become a meme. The media did not make him a meme; they merely capitalized on the attention once Ken Bone had already gone viral. He was not mass-produced by campaign offices and political propagandists. In an act of near-randomness, he was dubbed a meme by the distributed irrational network of sensation-seeking individuals we call the Internet.  The random series of viral creations in 2016 revealed that memes are fundamentally uncontrollable. After Harambe, damn Daniel, Ted Cruz the zodiac killer, how could we be surprised that Ken Bone was crowned a meme? </span>

Ken Bone could not even control what he himself symbolized. He attempted to control his own signifier by consistently exhorting people to vote and make their voices heard. But all his efforts, for the most part, failed. Ken Bone does not symbolize democratic participation. After all, m<span style="font-weight: 400;">emes are inherently dehumanizing. To become a meme, an image must be dissociated from its reality and turned into something else. In linguistics terms, it’s a sign whose signifier is malleable — the image’s meaning, thus, is created by those who share it. The meme itself has no power over its meaning. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the danger of living memes – they are tossed around by the whims of the Internet. And when these whims turn sour, the person suffers. Ken's slightly quirky reddit history was revealed, and he was painted as a monster. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I expect this process to continue endlessly: an individual becomes a sign that stands as a placeholder for a piece of political ideology. The individual is the object of immense attention, and then is tossed out like discarded trash. We should be careful that our memes do not make us think this is what people truly are. And we should not be surprised when the myth of the 'ordinary citizen' is shattered by the reality of the individual's life and being. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Suspend your disbelief for a moment, and imagine the 6-year-old daughter of a major world leader travels with her father to a major nuclear launch site. She is left unsupervised, and happens to wander into the launch room. There, out of curiosity, she presses the big red button.

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> This launches a nuclear weapon that immediately kills millions of people. Before the weapon has even detonated, other nations have launched missiles of their own. A single launch rapidly escalates to nuclear war. Billions of humans and nonhumans are killed, and the planet is left barely habitable. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This scenario is clearly implausible to the point of impossibility – the big red button, after all, </span><a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/12/15/button-isnt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t even exist.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, it is a useful archetype that raises serious questions for consequentialism. Consequentialism inadequacy in certain moral issues is clear when the accidental action of a small child leads to immense suffering. I’ll add another example that deals with similar issues, but that is far more likely.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A young boy happens to find a few matches on the floor of his family’s garage. While playing with them and scraping them across the rough floor, one of them ignites. In panic, the child rushes to the garbage and throws the match in. Then, losing interest, he walks inside and finds something else to do. The match lights a fire into the garbage which spreads into the house. The house burns to the ground, killing everyone inside. The fire spreads to nearby houses and kills or injures several more people. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of counterexample to consequentialism is demonstrably plausible, as there is empirical documentation of similar cases. According to the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/31/kids-accidentally-shot-people-5-times-a-week-this-year-on-average/?utm_term=.ee9886178df2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at least 265 Americans were accidently shot by children in 2015. Many of these shootings resulted in tragic deaths. Meanwhile, the number of </span><a href="http://www.snopes.com/toddlers-killed-americans-terrorists/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American fatalities due to terrorism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2015 was about 20, depending on certain counting methods. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a truly consequentialist atmosphere, accidental shootings by children would be discussed far more than terror attacks – precisely 13.25 times as much. Moral deliberation on an action would be indexed to the amount of pain or happiness caused by the action. But in reality, the ethical issue of terrorism is discussed prolifically, while accidental shootings by children are virtually ignored. Why is this the case? I argue that while the amount of discussion on terrorism doesn’t reflect consequentialism, it does reflect our moral intuitions. We assign greater condemnation to actions not based on the numerical impact of these actions, but based on the intention of the actor, the nature of the action, and the emotional impact of the action. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The probability of child accidents will only increase in our modern world, as dangerous technologies proliferate and become more available, the population expands, and systems become more interconnected. A single accidental action by a child can result in unfathomable pain. However, our moral intuitions indicate that accidental actions by children are not blameworthy. Can consequentialism reconcile this problem? </span>
<h3><b>Interpretation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I will use this definition of consequentialism, based loosely on the one from </span><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/#WhaCon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: </span></a>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The belief that consequences are the only normative property that affects the rightness of an action.” </span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, in simpler terms, an action is made right or wrong </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">only </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">by its consequences. Consequences are the only morally relevant consideration.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, if this essay shows that there are non-consequential normative properties that affect the rightness of an action, then consequentialism is false. I will use primarily an intuitionist approach to prove this claim – that is, showing that consequentialism is incompatible with clear moral intuitions. I will not touch on whether intuitionism is true; I will just discuss the consequences of its assumed truth. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Normative properties are defined as any ethical aspects of an action. This is a simple and non-rigorous definition that would be considered inadequate by many metaethicists, but it works well for the essay. For example, “rightness of intent” is a normative property, as it is an aspect that could impact the ethics of the action. Furthermore, this would be a non-consequential normative property. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the relevant normative properties in the examples above? I will consider the following: </span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Intent</strong> – the actor’s purpose or intended goal in a certain action. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Actor</strong> – the individual who commits the act. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Consequence</strong> – the morally relevant impacts of the action.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Different moral theories place different emphases on these properties; consequentialism is the theory that only the third property is relevant to the rightness of an action. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of the child pressing the red button, I believe we have clear answers as to the ‘value’ of these properties. The consequences are certainly bad. The intent is morally indifferent, as the child did not intend for anyone to suffer nor for anyone to benefit from her pressing the button. </span>

The most interesting property is the second. Our moral intuitions agree that the age of the actor is morally significant. If a child commits a crime, they are considered less morally responsible than adults. This intuition is ingrained in law – individuals are not usually morally responsible until the age of 18. Some religions have an ‘age of accountability,’ which makes people accountable to God for sins after it is reached. Since children are less capable of complex moral reasoning, they are less responsible for mistakes in this reasoning.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, there are also arguments for the moral relevance of the age of the actor that are not based on intuitions. For example, the following deductive argument: </span>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">P1. One is not morally responsible for what one does not know.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">P2. If one is not morally responsible for what one does not know, then people who know less than others are less morally responsible.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">P3. Children know less than adults. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">P4. Children are less morally responsible than adults. </span></p>
Thus, when the child presses the red button, and she does not know that this will fire a nuclear weapon, she is not morally responsible for the nuclear war that ensues. This argument attempts to prove that children in general are less responsible, but it can also be applied in any case where lack of knowledge is involved. If someone does not know the consequences or nature of an action, they are not morally responsible for this action.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on clear moral intuitions and the above deductive argument, the action of pressing the button is either (1) less wrong or (2) morally indifferent when the actor is very young or when the actor does not know the consequences. Either case means that the actor – a non-consequential normative property – affects the rightness of the action, disproving consequentialism. </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Kierkegaardian Approach to Philosophy: Replacing an Objective Career with a Subjective Relationship</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Philosophy has been firmly and comfortably institutionalized. It exists primarily to teach useful, marketable, career-building skills, buzzwords like critical thought and complex reasoning and clear writing. Philosophers are another cog of capitalism, mass-produced in university departments to either join the economy or perpetuate the academic study of philosophy. Like physicists and biologists, they are judged by their ability to produce original, peer-reviewed work. Philosophy is a specialized field along with the sciences, practiced in research institutions.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any ‘serious’ philosopher is found solely in the university; no longer can philosophy be practiced by any audacious questioner. Measured by gross product, philosophy is more successful and productive than at any other time in history. Thousands of philosophers throughout the world produce well-researched, logical papers that engage with the traditional problems. Many of these papers are ingenious marvels of philosophical reasoning. Who can deny the brilliance of Slavoj Zizek’s cultural criticism, John Searle’s philosophy of mind, the late Hilary Putnam’s rigorous analysis? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet perhaps we are missing something in this Cambrian explosion of philosophical activity. Philosophy has gained a permanent place in the academy. To paraphrase an</span><a href="https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/11/when-philosophy-lost-its-way/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduction to “Socrates Tenured”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Robert Frodeman and Adam Briggle, philosophy has its own arcane language, its hyper-specialized concerns, a network of undergraduate programs, and an ecosystem of journals. Like Bertrand Russell, I wonder whether institutional philosophy is “anything better than innocent but useless trifling, hair-splitting distinctions, and controversies on matters concerning which knowledge is impossible.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of philosophy is no longer to guide individuals on their attempt to become paragons of wisdom and virtue. Its purpose is not to assist the philosopher in reconciling the absurdity of the world, nor can it instigate the creation of meaning out of this nihilism. It is not meant to be related subjectively to the individual who is actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">living </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the philosophy and experiencing its effects. It is meant to produce knowledge. An honest, valuable task – yes. But it is not enough. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, this knowledge is produced in the typical academic fashion. It is based on rigorous, ‘impartial’ research by graduates trained in cleverly analyzing arguments. This research is then applied to produce objective knowledge that has no moral impact. I mean: the knowledge is not meant to make one a better person, but to be used as a “de-moralized tool” for civilizational progress (</span><a href="https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/11/when-philosophy-lost-its-way/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Throughout the process, the producers of knowledge remain separate from the knowledge they produce. It is sterilized, abstracted – without impact. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The philosopher argues passionately for his/her thesis, employing every art of logic available. But what if the thesis is true? No matter. It will not change the philosopher’s life nor anyone else’s. It is merely another postulate verified until refutation, another step on the track to tenure. As Kierkegaard wrote, “not until he lives in it, does it cease to be a postulate for him." It is ridiculous to imagine the philosophers living by their theses. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All this production and institutionalization is merely disguising a catastrophe. We are facing the same problem in philosophy that Kierkegaard faced in religion: the demise of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">subjective </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">relationship. We have lost the duty to philosophy that Socrates felt and in some ways died for, the intimately personal, individual relationship to the content of our study. At his final </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apology, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socrates said “as long as I draw breath and am able, I shall not cease to practice philosophy.” He had so fully embraced philosophy that any other form of life was “not worth living.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philosophy is not merely a set of practices and shared academic norms. It is a way of living. And if it fails to be a way of living, all its academia will be unmasked as hollow. Then could Nietzsche’s madman declare with certainty that along with God, the Philosopher must be buried as well – “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have killed him — you and I. We are all his murderers” (</span><a href="http://markandrewholmes.com/godisdead.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gay Science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Divorced from the lived experience of the philosopher, how can philosophy be meaningful? If philosophy is to have any value, it must be “through its effects upon the lives of those who study it” (</span><a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/RussellValuePhilosophy1912.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bertrand Russell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps no one but Kierkegaard has articulated this problem in all its scope. In his </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truth is Subjectivity, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">he wrote: </span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our discussion is not about the scholar's systematic zeal to arrange the truths of Christianity in nice tidy categories but about the individual's personal relationship to this doctrine, a relationship which is properly one of infinite interest to him. (</span><a href="http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/kierkegaardphil1reading.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To be a philosopher, one must take a radical leap. It is like Kierkegaard's leap of faith, the jump into the abyss. Namely: one must be willing to live by one’s conclusions. After all, philosophy claims to both describe and prescribe reality, the ethical life, the social sphere. If this is the case, then how should we live differently because of it? If Plato is indeed correct about the immortality of the soul, what then should we do? Every philosophical premise, when carried the full length, has an ethical conclusion. They dictate what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be done. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But even here we encounter a problem. We are supposed to live by our conclusions, yes, but we are also supposed to live by the method of philosophy. And yet this method questions every conclusion. How can we live by a conclusion that can be called into question and invalidated the day after? Philosophy is built upon the dialectic, the constant shift in thought and relentless doubt of each and every premise. An objector might claim that the dialectical is fundamentally antithetical to the meaningful, as a life cannot be built upon an ever-shifting foundation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps, then, Kierkegaard’s approach is only sensical in religion. After all, religion is not dialectical. It remains solid, and thus a subjective relationship can be built. A subjective relationship to religion builds a bridge between rock-solid cliffs; a subjective relationship to philosophy builds a bridge between wind and tossing waves. One must be able to stop somewhere if a meaning of life is to be built, and religion provides the stopping-point.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philosophy, however, is not incapable of providing meaning. It has merely been so often misapplied that it seems impossible to truly live by. The solution is this: one must be willing to set a direction for the dialectic. Kierkegaard himself did not set a rock of Christianity and declare “now, build a relationship with this!” His project was to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">advance, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not end the dialectic. His intention was to "create difficulties everywhere" (<a href="http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2009/02/08/to-create-difficulties-everywhere/#identifier_0_3354">Concluding Unscientific Postscript</a>). He sought to push individuals to recognize the flaws of dogma, and through this to create their own relationship with Christianity independent of the traditional Nicene doctrine. But this dialectic was not unguided: its goal was to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">become a Christian. </span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This aim, in a somewhat paradoxical sense, could only be achieved by first negating it: recognizing that I am not a Christian now. Thus, the dialectic became essential to the process. The creation of a true relationship with Christianity was made possible only through destruction – through eliminating the bromides and dependence on institutions. </span>

This same process of guided dialectic applies to philosophy. By focusing on a specific end goal, our dialectic gains a foundation. New information does not destroy the foundation. Rather, it clarifies and polishes the foundation and assists in its construction. For example, I may decide my end goal is to become a virtuous person. When I discover that one of my practices was not after all virtuous, this does not destroy my ability to live by my philosophy. After all, my end goal is not called into question. I still aim to be virtuous. But my process has been refined, as I now know one more thing that I should not aim for.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, we now have a basis for developing a personal relationship with philosophy. Before anything, an aim must be set as the goal of all dialectic. Then, we must live by this aim, constantly seeking to refine and expand it. The aim cannot be called into question. This aim is the fundamental, subjective truth, one that is lived by the individual so intensely that it cannot be invalidated. It must be of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">infinite </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">significance to the individual. It should not be taught in universities, but pursued by the individual. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We must </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">assume </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the end goal in order to justify the process itself. After all, if we open up our end goal to justification – and therefore criticism – how can we truly be devoted to it? It becomes merely another premise among many, one that may be quickly invalidated by a new paper in an academic journal. Only through the powerful, subjective force of faith can we believe in the end goal. (To clarify, I do not at all mean faith in the religious sense. You’ll catch my meaning as I develop the idea.) </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Faith, after all, is inevitable in life. Over the centuries, the most powerful trend in philosophy has been skepticism. We have certainly not completed Aristotle’s task of classifying and demonstrating everything, but we have made tremendous progress in Socrates’ task of calling everything into question. In a philosophy where there is no convincing demonstration of the possibility of knowledge itself, how can we claim to have a comprehensive system that eliminates the need for faith? Rather, we have merely shown the overwhelming need for faith. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Faith is a teleological suspension in the face of uncertainty. The need for this suspension derives from three fundamental and undeniable aspects of existence. First, we are uncertain at the most basic level, and unable to make a decision based on the process of systematic reasoning. Second, despite our uncertainty, we must make a decision. Third, and too often ignored, we have ends, desires, dreams – things that we feel we must accomplish or at least strive for. We may know objectively that these dreams are irrational, unjustified – and yet every individual feels a need to search after some aim. In the face of this </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">telos</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is unacceptable to merely deny agency and revoke our ability to make a choice, and it is unacceptable to choose arbitrarily.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How can we reconcile these three facts of our existence – uncertainty, agency, and the telos? Only through faith. We ignore our uncertainty, and make the decision based on the telos, the goal. We decide our ends and believe them by faith. Every decision must be directed by this touchstone. It is constantly refined through the dialectical process, but the telos itself is never subject to the dialectic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In his </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existenzphilosophie, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karl Jaspers wrote, “Philosophic meditation is an accomplishment by which I attain Being and my own self, not impartial thinking which studies a subject with indifference.” The philosopher should be intimately engaged with the philosophy; it should not be an object of study, but a way of living that has infinite impact. The goal of philosophy must be reexpressed in Kierkegaard’s terms, as the search to <strong>“find a truth that is truth </strong></span><strong><i>for me, </i>to find the idea for which I am willing to live or die.” </strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: right;"><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never again will I have to bear </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">the shrill of screams</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As some pitiful sibling endures a bath. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The mess of a house tearing at the seams,</span>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grateful hugs of a fragile sister.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nights cut short by a sharp curfew,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brothers wrestling as dirt flew,</span>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you know no one will ever hurt you.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents give unwanted advice, incessant</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always treat you like an adolescent.</span>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home falls far short of ideals.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than perfect homemade meals, </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every bedtime raucous with squeals. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Floor festooned with debris, never clean</span>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at least it’s never empty.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every week another crisis,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mom stressing about rice prices,</span>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laughs absorbed into yellowed sidewalls</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stepping on the floor where a child sprawls.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How can I walk out a door I’ve always walked in? </span>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where I’ve slept every year since birth,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where I know every edge and margin </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Where six placentas are buried in the garden.</span>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someday soon I’ll come home,</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To walk again the hills I once would roam, </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To see if the cracks in the ceiling have moved, </span>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And show somehow my worth I’ve proved. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet with my moth-eaten bed so old, </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And test if its springs still recognize my mold</span>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someday I’ll walk as always, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">through the same hallways,</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Look in the same eyes and see the same worries, </span>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it won’t ever be the same. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>“Somebody once told me the definition of hell: On your last day on earth, the person you became will meet the person you could have become.” — Anonymous</em>

<hr />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What if a demon slithered up to you after your graduation, and forced you to relive all of highschool? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No, not just the dances and the weekends, but every single moment. Would you scream, fall to the ground, and curse the demon? Or would you call him an angel and plead to do it again? Are you ready to walk down the middle school hallway an infinity more times? Are you willing to put on a polo every morning until Maeser’s logo is permanently stuck to your chest? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the joy, are you willing to reenact the routine, the broken relationships, the depression, the rejection, the failures, the boredom, the ugliness that comes packaged with every beautiful experience? I don’t care if you’re a senior or a 7th grader – could you affirm your life so far without a doubt? Could you live it again and again until each second becomes familiar? Do you want this – all of this – again, and countless times more? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If not, then start living so you can say yes to every single moment. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you live this way? Well, as usual, the answer you need is not what you’d like to hear: Don’t be yourself. Be more. Dare to reach outside of what you normally call yourself. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For most of highschool, I was exactly what others expected of me, and what I expected of myself. I was never anything but my usual self. But I needed to let go of those comfortable habits that are wearing away at my potential; I needed to I stop being me and start being more. </span>

Stop wandering the halls aimlessly, thinking of people in terms of stereotypes and first impressions. Stop looking at a person and assuming you know who they are. Start learning names and seeing eyes.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop walking past the teacher's door, glancing in, afraid to enter. Start building relationships with these spectacular people who can be your inspirations and your mentors.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop ignoring your Socratic books and stop skimming sparknotes the day of the test. Start learning so passionately that you can't remember what the assignment was.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop listening to to music you don't love because you feel like you should. Stop pretending you're a baller because you wear joggers with fake yeezys. Stop thinking you're edgy because you use words like 'edgy.' Stop bragging about how much you've procrastinated. Stop thinking that you have enough time. Stop being yourself, and start being more. </span>

In every typical suburban Utah house, right in between the picture of six kids and the religious painting, there’s a cute little sign that says: Remember who you are. But in some ways, that’s bad advice. So much joy can come when you who you’re supposed to be just slips your mind.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of your greatest moments will come when you forget who you are. The only reason I tried out for the soccer team was because I forgot I was supposed to be the awkward kid who reads philosophy books and talks too much in Socratic. Because I stopped being myself, I suffered through hours of sprints and San Diegos; weeks of stinging turf burns and soreness; food fights and brawls on a cramped bus; the painful inadequacy of missed passes. At the end of it all, I found unexpected strength and friends I never would have had otherwise.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only reason I took AP Calculus is because I forgot I’m bad at math. I barely kept up in Math One; I was mocked in elementary school for fumbling at long division and staring blankly at equations. For me, watching people manipulate numbers was like chasing cars on the freeway; I couldn’t possibly keep up. But eventually, I decided to stop being myself, and I signed up for Calculus. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do what you can’t. Whenever there is something you are afraid of, something you would love but you know you’ll never do – that is what you</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do. You know what I’m talking about. The girl. The performance. The adventure. Stop avoiding them. Start scaring yourself every day. If you jump off the cliff, you have no need to explain yourself to those who stand and watch. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be yourself. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop ‘discovering yourself.’ Stop waiting to stumble upon who you really are. You are more than just you; who you are striving to become. As Nietzsche said, “your true self does not lie buried deep within you, but rather rises immeasurably high above you, or at least above what you commonly take to be yourself.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop looking for yourself and start building yourself.</span>

<blockquote><em>Maeser Prep Academy Class of 2017</em></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am honored to give this speech, I really am, almost as much as I am under-qualified to give it. My speech will be kind of like high school: the best part is when it’s finally over. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Street philosopher and leader of the free world, Drake, once said “Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me. No help, that's all me, all me for real.” I just have to say, those lyrics are the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposite </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of how I feel right now. I am inexpressibly grateful for the people who have shaped me, inspired me, forgiven me, and helped me in endless ways. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, my parents and family. Their patience with me is inexhaustible, and there is almost nothing that they haven’t done for me. I’m sorry I don’t appreciate you enough. I’m thankful for my friends and fellow students; you almost certainly don’t expect it, but I look up to so many of you. You have made high school an exciting, enlightening, and sometimes strange experience. And of course, our teachers. We have the most inspiring teachers the world has ever seen. There are so many teachers here who could give better advice than I ever could. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to Mr. Watabe for teaching me that math is simple, and more importantly, life is simple. If you put in the effort, you will get faster, you will get better, and you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">might </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">even learn calculus. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to Mrs. Plott for making me realize that velocity is more important than speed; what direction you’re going matters more than how quickly you’re going.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am grateful to Mr. Dowdle for redeeming humanity despite the horrors of our past, for your effortless humor, and for your life-changing analysis of literature. I’m finally in uniform, by the way. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to Mrs. Frampton, for showing me that without art, writing, and even poetry, we cannot understand the sacredness of life. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to Mrs. Martinez, for encouraging us all to be more compassionate. Through her character, she showed us there is no qualification, no skill, and no aspect of your resume that is more valuable than the effect you have on others. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And Mr. Simmons - ah, what can be said about Mr. Simmons that he has not already told in excruciating detail to his freshman Socratic class? Thank you Mr. Simmons for demonstrating the meaning of education as sacred, and for your genuine dedication to your players and students. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to Mrs. Slade, for showing us the wonder of the natural world, the miracle of the human body, and the power of human potential. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you so much to Mrs. Sidwell, who isn’t here today. You introduced me to the sound of my own voice. The impact you had on my life cannot be underestimated. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t list all of my teachers and mentors, but I have been changed by every class I took at Maeser – yes, even Financial Lit. Especially Financial Lit. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maeser is one of the at the best high schools in the state. Honestly, it is easy to feel intimidated and inadequate in a school of stars like Maeser. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, not all of us have Logan Norris’ relentless determination; </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all of us are as kind as Morgan Millet; </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all of us have James Johnson’s flawless ability in acting;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all of us have the perfect calves of Felix Resendiz.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Few of us are as fearless as Bennett Felsted and Jared Drake, </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">None of us can do as many pull ups as Jacob Radmall, </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And David Van Horn isn’t here, but few of us are as mature, contemplative, or understanding as him. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all of us are as ready to give compliments as Brittany Oveson. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">None of us can beat Taylor Brand’s scoring record;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Few of us have the constant cheerfulness and optimism of Ben Hailstone or Maliana Corniea; </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Few of us have the easygoing attitude of Braden Christensen; </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Few of us have the quiet wisdom of Tashara Muhlstein; </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">None of us party as hard as Dakota Clubb; </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">None of us work as hard as Lia Joo; </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t all jump as far as Sammy Windley, sing as high as Varia Aird, or play the piano like Anastasia Felt.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">None of us can parkour like Olle Hansen.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Few of us have the resilience of Mustafa Hamidi; </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And even fewer of us have the hope and strength of Sophie Cannon. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I could keep going, I promise you. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite the fact that we can’t compare ourselves to the people around us, each of us has an opportunity – no, an obligation – to share our unique and powerful selves with the world. Growing up with you all in the last few years has been an incredible experience. Because of this, I will ask that you remember one thing after this speech: never think you have nothing original to say, never think you have nothing important to do, and never think you have no purpose. </span>

Often, our endless routine overwhelms us like the numbing smell of burnt popcorn in the cafeteria microwaves. The beating repetitiveness of everyday life causes us to reduce ourselves to just another student, just another worker, just another brick in the wall.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People often say things like this: “I don’t have time for philosophy. I have bills to pay.” If you have not yet said this, then just wait – in college, you will say it or at least think it. How do I know this? Well, I don’t, but I’m up here making sounds, and that’s the important thing. That’s what I’m here for. </span>

But honestly, it is easy to become swallowed up by the mundane parts of living. We should all be terrified that without even noticing, we will slip into a trivial life of grinding for grades, working for mere money, depending on empty praise, obsessing over flimsy worries and meaningless stresses, becoming something we aren’t to impress people we don’t like. Unless we watch closely, the ordinary will consume us. Unless you pay attention, your purpose will disappear like quicksand. Smooth and natural. With barely any sign you can notice or suspect. And you walk on it easily. When you've noticed your purpose is gone, it's too late.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So when you find yourself saying “I don’t have time for philosophy,” remember that this is not philosophy, this is life. You don’t have enough time to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">think about it. With every day, you should consider the fundamental, the deep, the sacred, the truth beyond the mundane. Otherwise, why wake up each morning? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Clear away all the debris that separates you from that essential, bright, illuminating part of yourself – that core that is much deeper than personality – your soul, your life-force, your chakra, or maybe it’s just your appendix or something. Avoid the things that reduce you and make you trivial, and look for those things that make you passionate, deep-thinking, and full. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Yutang said that “Those who are wise won't be busy, and those who are too busy can't be wise.” Reject the idea that you can afford to merely fill or kill time; your busyness will prevent you from seeing beyond routine. </span>

Well, as Dylan Armstrong said, I’m sorry Maeser, but I’m breaking up with you. Luckily, I’ve already set someone else set up so the rebound will be quick. She’s kind of out of my league, so I proposed to a bunch of backups in case she rejects me. Also, I’m going to need her to pay me like 50,000 dollars or it’s not going to work out. That’s basically what applying to college is.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll eventually forget about my times with Maeser, but I will remember what I learned from the relationship. After all, it lasted four years, and I have done so much with Maeser - my sweat is on her field, my tears are on her desks, and yes I admit it, my popcorn is in her microwaves. I learned that the pursuit of truth, the process and journey itself, is always worth it - even if that truth is as difficult to find as a high-quality meme on Facebook.

		<title>LDS Doctrine is Silent on Homesexuality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Who am I to write about LDS doctrine? I'm not a leader in the church. I'm not even a member of the church. But I'm interested in understanding the doctrine, and I've spent a large part of my life attempting to understand it. And I have a question: why is it an overwhelmingly common belief that LDS doctrine forbids homosexuality?

To be clear, I'm not a conspiracy theorist who denies that leaders in the LDS Church have declared that having "homosexual relations" is a sin. For example, Gordon B. Hinckley said exactly that in his statement <a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1987/05/reverence-and-morality?lang=eng&amp;_r=1"><em>Reverence and Morality</em></a>:
<blockquote>Prophets of God have repeatedly taught through the ages that the practices of homosexual relations, fornication, and adultery are grievous sins.</blockquote>
But, as it is said very often in the church, there is a crucial distinction between doctrine and policy, and between doctrine and the words of well-intentioned and righteous men/women. Doctrine is fixed and unchanging. It is defined in canonized works of LDS doctrine, especially the Book of Mormon and the Pearl of Great Price. It's my understanding that unless a principle is made permanent and unambiguous in these works of doctrine, it is subject to change. I'll cite the old and tired examples, and some fresh ones: polygamy, black people receiving the priesthood, the length of church on Sundays, the age missionaries leave. All of these things were declared as revelation by Church leaders, but are not immortalized in doctrine. They are not absolute; they may be wrong, and they certainly may change.

Imagine that you lived in the early days of the Church, before 1978. Would you have objected to the racist policy of excluding black men from the priesthood? Almost every modern Mormon would say yes to this question. Maybe they would have issued an impassioned criticism of the practice. Maybe they would have protested against it. Maybe they would have practiced civil disobedience, ordaining black men despite the words of their church leaders.

But in reality, only a miniscule, extremely select group of people in the church did anything like this. An overwhelming majority followed the policy for the century of its practice. While we understandably want to believe that we would be part of the minority, that is just statistically unlikely. Most people accepted and followed the incorrect revelation. You would have to be a very rare person to disobey it, using a different thought or revelatory process than everyone else in the church. This leads me to ask a critical question: If you, as a member of the church today, want to minimize your chance of practicing incorrect church policy, what would be the best approach?

To me, the answer seems clear: rest your beliefs and actions on personal revelation and on a deep and thorough understanding of the doctrine. If you followed this process, you are far less likely to follow incorrect policy. You would have been a conscientious objector to the racist practices of pre-1978 Mormonism. Nothing in the doctrine says anything about denying black people the priesthood. And it seems unlikely to me that a benevolent God would reveal to you that this practice is okay or good.

My argument is simple: there is nothing in LDS Doctrine that condemns homesexuality or declares that homosexual relations are a sin. Therefore, members should determine for themselves, through a personal revelation process, whether they should follow the policy of the church.

The Book of Mormon does not mention homosexuality anywhere. Neither does the Pearl of Great Price. This is a negative claim, and so can be disproved by a single instance — if you find an example of homosexuality being mentioned in these works, feel free to let me know and I'll change my belief. But the Topical Guide, the official index of topics in the scriptures, has a <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/tg/homosexual-behavior?lang=eng">section on Homosexual Behavior</a>, and it exclusively cites verses in the Bible. Many of these verses are vague and only <em>very </em>tenuously connected to homosexuality.

After all, <a href="http://theconversation.com/to-christians-arguing-no-on-marriage-equality-the-bible-is-not-decisive-82498">the Bible is not clear on homosexuality</a>. All of the most commonly-cited proofs that the Bible condemns it are <strong>not actually</strong> about homesexual relations. For example, there's the case of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 19, where the men of Sodom seek to rape two male visitors (who are in reality angels sent by God to see if the city contains any righteousness). God subsequently obliterates the city of Sodom. So God must hate the gays, right? Uh, no. It seems clear to me that the problem here is that it's <em>rape. </em>Why would you make the conclusion that God condemns homesexuality? The more sensible and humane conclusion, based on the text, would be that God condemns sexual violence and rape.

Another case in the Bible is Leviticus 18:22. They say that a man lying with another man instead of his wife is an 'abomination.' But this is a man <em>committing adultery </em>with another male. We already know that adultery is a sin and abomination according to the Bible. Why would we assume that this case is about homesexuality either? It seems more clear that it's another condemnation of adultery. Also, I'd be cautious attaching too much meaning to the word 'abomination.' The Bible uses it very loosely. Things that the Bible says are abominations: Egyptians eating with Hebrews, sacrificing your child to Molech, eating pork, wearing mixed-fabric clothing, interbreeding animals of different species, and trimming your beard. You've gotta believe and do some weird things if you believe anything declared an abomination in the Bible is wrong.

Not to mention that if you're a Mormon, the Old Testament is almost definitely not the highest-ranking thing on your "list of books that matter." As far as I've seen, members think of The Book of Mormon, Pearl of Great Price, New Testament, and the words of modern prophets, in roughly that order, as more accurate (closer to the word of God) than the Old Testament with all its quirks.

The most important text on this topic is probably the <a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation?lang=eng&amp;old=true">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</a>. While I'm not sure if it is Doctrine, the Proclamation is a key document, signed by all the members of the presidency, cited constantly as doctrinal support for church policies on homosexuality and gender. And yet even this document is not clear about homosexual relations being a sin. Here are the relevant lines:
<blockquote>solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God</blockquote>
This is not an <em>exclusive </em>statement. It merely says that marriage between men &amp; women is ordained; not that marriage between men &amp; men or women &amp; women is <em>not </em>ordained. If you interpret this statement as exclusive of all other types of marriage, polygamy is also wrong — after all, it's marriage between a man and multiple women, not a marriage between "a man and woman," as it seems the Proclamation requires. Does that mean it's not ordained of God? But it clearly was ordained of God in the past. Therefore, the question is still open.
<blockquote>We further declare that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife.</blockquote>
You might think this one is abundantly clear. After all, it contains the key word: "only." But it's actually a tautology: the "sacred powers of <em>procreation" </em>CAN only be employed between men &amp; women. Gay sex is not reproductive or procreative. This is a fact of biology; human reproduction through meiosis requires sperm and an egg, which can be naturally produced only in male and female reproductive organs respectively. So this statement doesn't prohibit homosexual relations either or declare them a sin.

Maybe you could conceive this statement as prohibiting two Mormons in a gay marriage from having kids through surrogacy or in-vitro fertilization, as then they would be using the "sacred powers of procreation" with someone outside of their marriage (the surrogate or sperm donor). But then this would also prohibit an infertile Mormon man or woman in a straight marriage from using IVF or surrogacy either.

Also, slight loophole: gay people can adopt. They don't have to use the "sacred powers of procreation" to have kids.
<blockquote>Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan.</blockquote>
Same case as above; this is not exclusive. Marriage between a man and a women is essential; that doesn't mean other types of marriage aren't also allowed or essential.
<blockquote>Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity.</blockquote>
Gay people can do all of this. They can be fathers &amp; mothers; they can honor marital vows with complete fidelity; they can have children within the bonds of matrimony (through adoption, IVF, surrogacy, etc).

My argument is not that LDS Church leaders are definitely wrong about their own doctrine. My argument is that is a <em>possibility. </em>It has precedent. Members should not by default accept the statements of leaders. And I think it's clear that  nothing in the established, canonized LDS doctrine prohibits homosexuality. <strong>It is silent, or where it speaks, it is vague and open to multiple interpretations.</strong> This cannot be an accident — after all, for members of the church, the doctrine is revelation from God through His prophets. Is it likely that God would just forget about homosexuality, and fail to make a clear and unambiguous stand on this critical issue? Or is it more likely that it is not mentioned for a reason? What might that reason be?

I cannot answer these questions, only ask them. I cannot decide for members what their religion believes. I can only argue for caution and carefulness in following church policy without a thorough reading of the doctrine and an analysis of its interpretations. I hope that all church members undertake this reading. I would also hope that all church members use personal revelation in their decision-making process, including attempting to understand LGBT people through direct conversation, reading, and research.

If it turns out that after going through this entire process, LDS people find a doctrinal or personal-revelatory basis for treating homosexual relations as a sin, so be it. I'll be surprised but interested. Please let me know what this basis is.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>To End All Wars</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2016/11/world-war-i-in-photos-the-western-f-1/w_39/main_900.jpg?1479064171" />

About four years ago, I read <em>All Quiet on the Western Front </em>by Erich Remarque on a Sunday in November, a lot like this one. It was painful. Paul (the "protagonist," if there is one) is a brutal narrator. Reading most of the book in a day made his story more real, rushed, and urgent. I remember reading certain parts and shutting the book out of horror. Crying wasn't rare.

During most of high school, I would say <em>All Quiet</em><em> </em>was my favorite book. I'm not sure why. Not because I 'enjoyed' it. Only a sadist could. Maybe because it immersed me, and Paul's voice had been inscribed on my mind. His story was more concrete and rattling than any history I'd learned before. While it is a novel and Paul did not exist in a literal sense, millions of people experienced his story. As shameful as it is to say, these millions had just never been real to me. As Camus, who lived through WWII in France, wrote:
<blockquote>“<span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span>what are a hundred million deaths? ... Since a dead man has no substance unless one has actually seen him dead, a hundred million corpses broadcast through history are no more than a puff of smoke in the imagination.” — <em>Albert Camus, The Plague, pg. 4. </em></blockquote>
Reading the book made these deaths more than just a puff of smoke; or at least, it made a few of these deaths real. Remarque turned them into ink on paper, which became thoughts and memories ingrained in neurons in my brain. Once-empty phrases gained powerful meaning: “Bombardment, barrage, curtain-fire, mines, gas, tanks, machine-guns, hand-grenades - words, words, but they hold the horror of the world" (<em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em>, 46). If only the generals and political leaders of WWI were able to read this book during the war. Then again, most of them experienced the nightmarish inspiration for <em>All Quiet </em>firsthand, and most were still able to dissociate it from their actions and continue the war.

I feel intense anger at the generals who tossed away countless lives mindlessly. They had an attitude similar to Napoleon's:
<blockquote>“You cannot stop me. I can spend 30,000 men a month.” — <em>Napoleon Bonaparte, Letter to Klemens von Metternich</em></blockquote>
Human life is the currency of war. The WWI generals were spending it. They poured hundreds of thousands of human bodies into Verdun, the Somme, Ypres, the Marne, like they were depositing piles of cash into the morbid bank of war. The supreme commander of the Allied forces in 1918, known for being reckless with human life during the Flanders, First Marne, and Artois campaigns, said something reminiscent of Napoleon's quote:
<blockquote>“It takes 15,000 casualties to train a major general.”  — <em>Ferdinand Foch (source:<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=54MTDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=it+takes+15+000+casualties+to+train+a+major+general&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UyeYVmxPWX&amp;sig=SAFi2FvZeGtPY2xAIAfAdbw_maM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi8zLDgps3eAhVr64MKHZtTDO8Q6AEwCXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=it%20takes%2015%20000%20casualties%20to%20train%20a%20major%20general&amp;f=false"> Nine Divisions in Champagne</a> by Patrick Takle)</em></blockquote>
Doesn't it sound like he's quoting a price: we could train this general, but it will cost us 15,000 lives? Is that all the Great War was to these generals? A storm of prices, budget allocations, necessary costs, spending decisions? But behind each number was not a dollar but an individual, usually a man around my age, torn away from life and drafted into the process of destroying it en masse.
<blockquote>“I am young, I am twenty years old; yet I know nothing of life but despair, death, fear, and fatuous superficiality cast over an abyss of sorrow. I see how peoples are set against one another, and in silence, unknowingly, foolishly, obediently, innocently slay one another.” <em>— Erich Maria Remarque, <a href="https://explainallquietonthewesternfront.weebly.com/uploads/2/4/7/2/24722875/all_quiet_on_the_western_front.pdf">All Quiet on the Western Front</a>, Ch. 10</em></blockquote>
<img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2016/11/world-war-i-in-photos-the-western-f/w_06/main_900.jpg?1478729903" />

I find it hard to imagine that these people were the same as we are. Were people just different back then? Their generation went through horrors we cannot imagine, and then went through them again in the Second World War. Could my generation survive the trenches? Could we slog through the mud of Passchendaele, our minds broken by the beating of artillery and the sight of death, and continue to fight? I think the answer is yes; but I hope we never get the opportunity to prove it.

No one would like to think they are capable of atrocity or extraordinary violence. But this belief disregards history. Many of the people who reported the Armenian genocide during WWI, who decried the Ottomans for their brutality and inhumanity, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-armenian-genocide-shaped-the-holocaust">were German</a> military officers operating in Turkey. They thought they were fundamentally different from the monsters they condemned. Twenty-one years later, some of the same people would be involved in committing Holocaust. We all have a capacity for barbarity. Only by recognizing its existence and working against it can we prevent repeating history.
<blockquote>“If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?” — <em>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag </em><span style="font-style: normal;"><em>A</em>rchipelago</span></blockquote>
We failed to make good on our ancestor's promise that WWI would be the war to end all wars. It has been one hundred years, and this planet has been scarred by more atrocity, violence, and mass destruction. Perhaps more than even veterans of the Great War could imagine.

<img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2016/11/world-war-i-in-photos-the-western-f/w_40/main_900.jpg?1478729904" />

Now, we live in the most peaceful time in history by most metrics. There hasn't been a direct confrontation between great powers since 1945. But our peace is almost as fragile as the "concert of Europe" before World War 1. Almost all of the world's major powers could obliterate life on Earth with a nuclear war and subsequent nuclear winter. Global military spending (the combined defense spending of every country) is at an all-time high (<a href="http://fortune.com/longform/global-military-spending-is-at-record-levels-and-rising/">source</a>). Seemingly minor movements, like China's expansion into the South China Sea and Russia's invasion of Crimea, reveal the tension underlying the global geopolitical order.

<img src="https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/rap_mil_spend_08.png" />

And nationalism is making a resurgence globally. About a week ago, Jair Bolsonaro came to power in Brazil. This is a self-proclaimed nationalist who has said things like "I'm in favor of the military regime," "it's all right if some innocent people die. Innocent people die in many wars," and "The only mistake of the dictatorship was torturing and not killing" (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jair_Bolsonaro">source</a>). Our president has said “I'm a nationalist. OK? I'm a nationalist. Nationalist. Use that word" (<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/macron-decries-plague-of-nationalism-right-in-front-of-donald-im-a-nationalist-ok-trump">source</a>). Far-right parties are gaining momentum in Europe. These trends should worry anyone who has read about the first half of the 20th century.

I remember hearing that the last WWI veteran had died, when I was 13. I didn't understand this much, but I had listened to my grandpa's stories about Vietnam; I was sad I would never be able to hear about WWI from someone who was actually there. I will probably also live through the death of the last person who fought in WWII, the last person who experienced the Holocaust. I have a friend who is an international student from Rwanda. His parents lived through the genocide. He told me that they constantly remind him to tell his children their stories, for when the generation who remembers an atrocity disappear, the atrocity once again becomes possible.

There are twenty-seven years until the centennial of World War II. These years should be treated as a test for humanity, everyone alive today, and our global political system. Have we overcome global war, permanently ended it? Over these two decades, will we repeat what happened in the last century?

<em><strong>Note: </strong>Over the past month, I've listened to Dan Carlin's Blueprint for Armageddon podcast about WWI. It's amazing. It has a perfect balance between historical fact, primary sources, background info, and his personal analysis. And <a href="https://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-50-blueprint-for-armageddon-i/">it is free</a>! People (including me) pay thousands for college lectures that are far worse than this podcast. Yes, all parts combined it's about 15 hours long. But it is important and worth it, and strung out over a few weeks of listening while driving, running, walking, etc, that isn't that much time. </em>]]></content:encoded>
